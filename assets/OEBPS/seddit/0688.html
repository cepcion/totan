<p class="TaleDestiny">(688) - QUICK THINKING, LUCK</p>
<p>The blaze is fearsome but you dash to the rescue. You search the house but find no one. When you emerge, you are shocked to be accosted and accused of setting the fire!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although there is no proof, the Sultan has you sorely beaten as a warning to other arsonists. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, LUCK</span>: In a desperate gambit, you tell your accusers that you are the owner of the house! Fortunately, no one ever claims otherwise, and you are acquitted and inherit the remains of the house with its contents. [D+1 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / Beguiling]</p>
