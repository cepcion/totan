<p class="TaleDestiny">(1805) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You decide to try your hand at pearl diving, hoping to make a small fortune. Holding your breath, you plunge to the bottom. But instead of finding a pearl bed, you find an ancient shipwreck! You try to get close enough to investigate, but a great shark emerges from the wreck!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As soon as you see the shark, you swim for the safety of the shore. You barely reach an outcropping of rock as the shark snaps at your heels! You thank Allah for delivering you from a terrible fate. [S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: All you have to defend yourself is your pearl knife. Against such a terrifying creature, you cannot imagine it will be enough, but you know you cannot outswim the greatest hunter of the deep! As the beast approaches, you pray to the Most High for true aim and stab at its sensitive nose. Confused by the sudden pain and the smell of its own blood, the shark writhes about. You grab a loose amphora from the wreckage and flee to the safety of shore. Inside the amphora you find an interesting bauble. [D+1 / S+1 / Ionian Gems]</p>
