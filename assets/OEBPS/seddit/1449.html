<p class="TaleDestiny">(1449) - STORYTELLING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>You have heard much about the powers of the Djinn, and you endeavor to fool the other into granting you a wish.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is not given to kind feelings towards those who importune him, and dismisses you with a gesture. With each step you take away from him, you feel your mind slip away&hellip; [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: The other sees through your feeble attempts to trick him. However, he is not angered; your lie is amusing enough to distract him from his unhappy life that he imparts to you a bit of knowledge of strange and wondrous lands. [D+2 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter any <a href="PlacesofPower.html">Place of Power</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> The other is not given to kind feelings towards those who importune him, and dismisses you with a gesture. You feel the Protective Talisman glow warm against your flesh, and know that only it has spared you from the wrath of the other. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
