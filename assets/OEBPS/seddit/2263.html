<p class="TaleDestiny">(2263) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s fervor is unsettling&mdash;so unsettling that he turns over several carts in the market. You decide to do something about it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to get the other to slow down&mdash;just a bit&mdash;to get him to arrange some kind of settlement with the merchants. As he just will not listen, you and the merchants decide that a different course must be pursued, and the other is taken to the square and beaten. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You arrange with the merchants for the other to repair their carts and help them deliver goods. This arrangement works out well as the other applies his busy nature to a productive cause. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
