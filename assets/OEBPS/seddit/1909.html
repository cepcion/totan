<p class="TaleDestiny">(1909) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You lure the ill-fated other to the wharf, where you know you will have ample opportunity to rob him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, you aren&rsquo;t the only thief working the docks tonight. Before you can strike your mark, a blow to the back of your head leaves you unconscious. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: To prevent him from turning witness against you, you lure the sickly other onto a ship you know to be leaving with the tide. Once you stow him aboard securely, you take his purse and make your way back to shore. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
