<p class="TaleDestiny">(1892) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other lies in a ditch, too ill to survive. You sit and comfort him until he passes. You learn that he was a wealthy merchant before his illness cost him his health and his fortune. His greatest wish is to see his business flourish one last time before he dies.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You conclude that it wasn&rsquo;t only illness that cost the other his fortune. His business is nothing but a way to lose money. You try to cut your losses. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: The other has very unusual business ideas, but you see the potential in it. You are sad that he didn&rsquo;t live long enough to see it, but his heirs will be well cared-for. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
