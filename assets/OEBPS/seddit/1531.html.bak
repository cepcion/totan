<p class="TaleDestiny">(1531) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, MAGIC</p>
<p>The jailor&rsquo;s visage is so horrid it may be a weakness that can be exploited. You tell the jailor you are able to change his face if he so wishes and would gladly do it for the price of freedom.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The jailor scoffs at your boast. &ldquo;It is the will of Allah to give me the face I show the world and no man may change it.&rdquo; [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The jailor is skeptical but you are able to apply powders and creams strategically to hide some of the twisted features. You give instructions to the jailor on how to maintain this look when you are free. The jailor is not confident enough to do this on his own, so he keeps you imprisoned and makes you apply your skills every day. You should have gotten his vow before helping him! [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: With but a few gestures, the twisted features of the jailor change and his appearance is more tolerable. The jailor releases you as agreed, more out of awe of your power than gratitude. You leave quickly and make haste to put a lot of distance between the two of you for you know that your magic will not hold those features too much longer. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
