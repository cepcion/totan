<p class="TaleDestiny">(1692) - MAGIC, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>A dread, three-headed, dozen-armed jinni stands before you. It is legendary, spoken of only in hushed tones as an unbeatable monster that has slain many men in their quest for glory.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You prepare for battle and engage the creature. It lashes out at you with a flurry of swords like strikes of lightning. You manage to deflect many of its attacks, but you cannot even manage a single counter-stroke. As you despair of surviving, your opponent trips on its own legs and you flee without a thought. You consider yourself fortunate to have escaped in a single piece. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You see that conventional skill of arms will fail against the creature. You opt for a less subtle approach, conjuring a mighty wind to carry the demon off into the distance. You grab its treasure and flee before it returns. [D+2 / S+2 / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: The fury of the creature is great, but the power of the ancient magic that you command is greater still! After an epic battle, you finally emerge triumphant! [D+3 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
