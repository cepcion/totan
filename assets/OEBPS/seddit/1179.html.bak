<p class="TaleDestiny">(1179) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>As you sail the seas, you spy a group of merfolk. You steer their way and descend into the water to speak with them. Suddenly a great dendan comes upon you, and the merfolk flee.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shout to kill the dendan, but are so buffeted by waves that you cannot manage it. You are swallowed, imprisoned in the creature&rsquo;s insides, and tossed up long after on strange shores. [D-1 / Move to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: One of the merfolk stays with you; seeing you struggle in the water, she supports you. You shout and slay the creature.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are not Married</span>: You do not return directly to the ship, though, but remain in the water in the arms of the Sea-Born who has saved you. Together, you explore the differences between her race and yours. When finally you do return to the ship, she comes aboard with you, professing her undying love. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are Married</span>: You return to the ship in the company of the sea-dweller, and converse with her long into the night, discoursing on the differences between your peoples. When finally she departs, she grants you a gift. [D+2 / S+1 / Dendan Oil]</li>
