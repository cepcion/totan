<p class="TaleDestiny">(2470) - SEDUCTION (if you are female)</p>
<p>You located the nest of a mighty roc, and found a lone egg within. You know that the Sultan will reward you handsomely for it. You approach the local captain of the Sultan&rsquo;s troops for assistance transporting the egg. But the treacherous worm has you arrested!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are cast into the captain&rsquo;s dungeon while he takes all the credit for your discovery. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION (if you are female)</span>: You use all of your charms and wiles to convince the captain to share the rewards with you. So swayed is he by your seductive ways, he is ill-prepared when you tell the Sultan the truth of his greedy betrayal. The Sultan has him cast in irons and appoints you to the now-vacant position. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
