<p class="TaleDestiny">(2552) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Visiting a relative&rsquo;s home, you are surprised when a troop of soldiers burst in and arrest the homeowner for murder! You console the family and plead before the local magistrate, but to no avail. On the day of execution, you infiltrate the guards while the family causes a distraction. Spiriting the other away, you both flee into the desert.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The desert is a harsh place. You are unable to keep your relative alive during the long trek. You have done the family little good.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (SOLDIER)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The two of you do not stop until you are far into the hills east of your village. Although life is hard, you both survive. In time, your relative, who is a scholar, explains that if certain books can be secured from the family&rsquo;s home, you may be able to clear her name. You sneak into town and find the volumes. Later, you both appear before the magistrate and cite an obscure law that allows a person with family who performs a pilgrimage to Mecca to offer a goat to stave off punishment for a crime. In this way, your relative is freed. You, however, are guilty of helping a prisoner to escape. You flee back into the desert. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
