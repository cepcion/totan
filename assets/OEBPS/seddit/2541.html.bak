<p class="TaleDestiny">(2541) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You have loved another for many years but are too ashamed to admit it. One day, you find that your love has been ensorcelled by a magician. You vow to break the enchantment so you can finally express your true feelings.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You arrive at your love&rsquo;s home and proclaim your devotion. You denounce the magician as an evil manipulator. Your love laughs at you, and you walk away with nothing but a curse to mark your folly.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You follow the magician and your love, studying their interactions. You discern a flaw in the magician&rsquo;s spell. With further research, you discern the proper counter-incantations and slowly break down the enchantment. When your beloved is free of the mental duress, you appear, explain your actions, and confess your love, which is immediately returned tenfold. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</p>
