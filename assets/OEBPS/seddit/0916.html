<p class="TaleDestiny">(916) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>As you journey along, you spy in the distance a dark road whose surface seems to ripple with a current. As you draw near, you realize that the road is covered by a mass of huge, writhing black snakes. You turn to flee, but see that the snakes have surrounded you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You feel the sting of a viper&rsquo;s bite and commend your soul to Allah. Weakness fills your limbs, but by the mercy of the All-Powerful, you do not die. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
