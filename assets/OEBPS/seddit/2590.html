<p class="TaleDestiny">(2590) - QUICK THINKING, WISDOM</p>
<p>After a great adventure, you secure a treasure map. According to the notes on the parchment, the entryway to the valuables is guarded by a magical ward. Only a holy man in the throes of religious fervor may enter. Seeking among a group of dervishes, you find one who will teach you the proper dance to achieve purity. In return, he asks only one thing: That you abandon any material wealth and devote yourself to the ways of Allah.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Such a bargain gains you nothing. You might gain great treasure but could not enjoy it. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, WISDOM</span>: You accept. You will have to rid yourself of all your gold, but no doubt the magical treasures to be found in the cave will serve you well as you embark on a new life devoted to Allah.
[D+2 / W-4 (Min: Penniless) / Piety / Draw two Treasures]</p>
