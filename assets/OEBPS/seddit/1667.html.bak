<p class="TaleDestiny">(1667) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>In a strange village, you are surprised to find one of the jinni sobbing on a street corner! The other explains that a human had bound him into service with a terrible spell, forcing him against his nature to perform deeds of great cruelty. You swear to break the spell.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hasten to find the evil-hearted sorcerer and berate him for forcing such a noble spirit into bondage. The wizard smiles and says, &ldquo;I will gladly trade that one&rsquo;s freedom for yours!&rdquo; Before you can respond, you find yourself bound. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You find the wizard, a minor prince of this land, and invite him to dine. Over a fine meal, you bring him to mind of how ignoble it is to oppress the less fortunate and how the mercy of the Most High extends even to the people of the fire. Ashamed, the wizard immediately releases his prisoner. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
