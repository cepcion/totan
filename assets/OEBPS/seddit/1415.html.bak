<p class="TaleDestiny">(1415) - APPEARANCE  (M)</p>
<p>The other travels with a hairless ape. You question him about it. He places his arm around the ape and says, &ldquo;My friend has been trapped in a beast&rsquo;s form by an evil enchanter, for no cause at all. Until someone kisses these ugly lips, my friend will remain a wretched beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are willing to try.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Acting and Disguise</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: You cannot bring yourself to kiss an ape. The enchantment remains. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: You manage a formal peck on the lips of the beast, and it is transformed into a ferocious &rsquo;efreet who bellows in rage at the one who has imprisoned him and goes to attack him. Unfortunately, the fiery blast of his departure burns you badly. The other gestures, and your wounds heal, but not completely. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> The very thought of kissing an ape is revolting. You shun the other and his ape. The other starts to walk off, but the ape gives you a nasty bite before his &ldquo;owner&rdquo; leads him away.
[D+1 / Roll one die; on a 1 or a 2, gain <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
