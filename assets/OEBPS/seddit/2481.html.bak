<p>Traveling along a lonely road, you come to a fork. One side leads into a dank jungle, the other into a scorching desert. Standing in the middle of the road is a scrawny other. &ldquo;Bwah hah ha!&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;You will never guess. One way leads to certain doom, the other to uncertain riches.&rdquo; You leap forward, grabbing the annoying one by the throat. &ldquo;Tell me or you won&rsquo;t live to learn of my choice!&rdquo; The other coughs and looks you in the eye, &ldquo;Now now, that isn&rsquo;t how the game is played. But since you are so keen, I will give you a hint: In one the water is low, in one the water is high, but in neither comes the water of Allah.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Scholarship</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wilderness Lore</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;5: You strike the infuriating wretch. Immediately, two large men appear from the shadows. You fight them well, but are robbed of all you own. [W-3 (Min: Penniless)]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">6&ndash;8: Water high is where you can use it. You head off into the jungle. It is humid, true, but the lack of trails and your inability to see make it hard to navigate. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9&ndash;10: Water low must be the desert. Surely water kept safely out of the sun can always be found. You head off into the desert, anxious to find your reward. [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">11+: If the water of Allah is not in the desert, and not in the jungle, where could it be? You head straight, ignoring both paths. Soon you find a crystal pool, in which lie many treasures. Touching none, you continue on your way. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</li>
