<p>The captain&rsquo;s paranoia seems to increase every day, and every day he sits in his cabin, most likely protecting his hoard.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In a rare moment when the captain is absent from the cabin, you sneak in and grab some items. Later, the captain calls all hands on deck and declares that someone has stolen from him and produces page upon page of tightly written manifests to prove his case. He declares the ship will not enter port until the culprit is found. The crew has had enough, mutinies, and throws the captain overboard. You have gotten away cleanly but feel very sad at the loss of the captain.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: While the captain goes on some rounds, you attempt to sneak into his cabin. However, someone is there before you! Lest you get caught, you overpower the villain from behind, just as the captain returns suddenly. He sees that you have stopped a thief and rewards you generously, as well as making you his first mate. [D+2 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
