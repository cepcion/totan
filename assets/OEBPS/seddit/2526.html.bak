<p class="TaleDestiny">(2526) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You encounter a young man sitting forlornly in front of his home, a sad bouquet of old flowers dangling in his hand. Sitting down beside him, you ask, &ldquo;So friend, who is she?&rdquo; He tells you that the daughter of a local tanner has rebuffed his advances, even though her father approves of him. She loves another, the son of the magistrate. You offer this advice: &ldquo;My friend, if you wish to win her heart, you cannot do so with sad gifts and a sad face. You must fight for her love!&rdquo; He cries out, &ldquo;Of course! I must fight for her love!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He runs off. Sadly, his skill is no match for that of the magistrate&rsquo;s son. He returns home rejected, wounded, and angry at you.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You smile, &ldquo;No, my friend, the trick is subtlety. You must woo your love with all the arts of romance. Show her that you are sensitive and caring but strong and protective.&rdquo; You teach him about the fine art of courting a woman. The next morning he returns home and smiles. &ldquo;Thanks to you, my friend, we are set to be married, and I wish to reward you for your help.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
