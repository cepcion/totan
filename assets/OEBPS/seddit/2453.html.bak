<p class="TaleDestiny">(2453) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Making your way along a narrow mountain path, you see a half-starved horse struggling along the path. Despite its poor condition, you can see from its fine saddle and harness that the horse belongs to someone of wealth and power. Such beasts are loyal beyond measure.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You follow the horse, hoping that it will lead you to its master. But the creature is weak and begins to stumble. You quickly offer the poor beast a bag of oats, which it greedily devours. Unfortunately, it seems that the noble animal has chosen you as a new master, and shows no interest in leading you any further. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You carefully approach the beast and offer it a handful of grain. Giving it just enough to keep going, you coax it into guiding you to its master, whom you find starving and unconscious near the path. You revive the young emir, who is eager to reward you. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
