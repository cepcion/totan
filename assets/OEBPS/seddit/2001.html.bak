<p class="TaleDestiny">(2001) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>A hirsute man loudly hawks his miraculous hair-growth ointment to all passers-by of bald pate. Curious, you approach and ask about the ointment&rsquo;s ingredients. The man claims it is an ancient family recipe, responsible for his full head of lush hair, and will not describe it further. You suspect a deception.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You continue to pester the man with questions until he tires of your antics and packs up his vials. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Your erudite inquiries show the man that you are knowledgeable about the various properties of herbs and concoctions. During your disquisition, a crowd gathers. His inability to answer even simple queries about the subject convince the audience that he is a fraudster. Impressed, the gathering showers you with praise. One comely member, checks aglow with rapture, seeks your company. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
