<p class="TaleDestiny">(1089) - None</p>
<p>As you walk along, you see coming your way a most strikingly peculiar man. Despite the heat, he is clad in a thick woolen robe, and over his eyes is a mask; and around his neck is a shining necklace, from which emerges the sound of ten musicians playing, very poorly. You know bad magic when you see it, and make large the distance between yourself and this dangerous other. [S+1]</p>
