<p class="TaleDestiny">(2109) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>In this land, you have heard amazing stories of a Magnetic Mountain not far from where you have camped. Such a curiosity must be investigated! But you also have heard of the dangers of this strange place, and before you dare come close, you ask all whom you meet for advice and assistance in approaching it. After sifting all the stories, you set aside every metal object you own and walk towards the mountain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The base of the cliff is littered with the bones of unfortunate travelers who were not warned in time, and a fortune in metal goods can be seen deeply imbedded in the cliff wall. You thank Allah, the Merciful, for sending you a warning before you continue on your way. [S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You have heard sailors from China describe a magnetic device for telling direction. You believe that the curious rocks of this Magnetic Mountain would be perfect for such a device. You carefully approach the mountain, and using a stone hammer, you chip away a small sliver of the magnetic rock. With the help of two strong horses, you pull the tiny chip of stone away from the mountain, and use it to build your own compass to aid in your sailing. [D+1 / S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
