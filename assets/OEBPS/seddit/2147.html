<p class="TaleDestiny">(2147) - None</p>
<p>You have heard of an ancient city filled with riches in this area. After many days of searching, however, all you have found are a few old ruined walls. However, you create a map based on them that you sell to passing strangers. Incredibly, one such stranger returns days later, in a caravan with a hundred camels and a thousands guards, laden with bags of gold and jewels. He thanks you profusely for the map that led him to the treasure. He rewards you for your help. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
