<p class="TaleDestiny">(1363) - LUCK, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You view many marvels and mysteries. One day you are brought before a great king who wishes to visit the upper world.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You offer to be his guide and he gratefully accepts. Much honor is yours, both in the world of land and the world beneath the waves. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, APPEARANCE</span>: You and he could be born of the same womb! Seizing the opportunity, he asks you to take his place as Sultan until he returns, gives you the royal robes (to hide your lack of a tail) and swims off. [D+3 / S+3 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
