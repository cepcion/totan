<p class="TaleDestiny">(1785) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Hopelessly lost, you&rsquo;ve wandered aimlessly for days. You have nearly given up hope of ever returning to civilization when you see a glimmering palace on the next ridge. You thank Allah for showing you the right path, and proceed to the curious palace.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are greeted by Shaykh Nasr, the King of Birds and the sole occupant of the Palace. He listens to your unfortunate tale and offers to help you as best he can. He summons a great roc and orders it to deliver you to your destination. How impressed will the people be when you arrive on the back of an enormous eagle! [D+1 / Move to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You discover the master of the palace, Shaykh Nasr, tending to a bird wounded by a hunter&rsquo;s arrow. You tell him that you know of a healing herb if he can help you collect it. He does so, and the bird is soon healed and sent on its way. In exchange for your kindness, Nasr shares his knowledge of the birds of the world. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
