<p class="TaleDestiny">(2072) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>Hiking your way across a lonely mountain pass, you are surprised to come upon a woman and her daughter, both leaning out over a yawning precipice. When you ask what brings them here, the mother tells you that they must climb down to the nest of the Roc, a giant bird of myth and legend, and steal one of its eggs, for only the yolk of a Roc egg can heal the young girl of the illness which she says is consuming her from the inside out.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Believing the hand of Fate to be at work in your life, you eagerly volunteer to help the woman acquire the precious egg. You climb down the cliff face and are nearly blown off by the harsh winds, but manage to snatch the egg and make off with it before the mother Roc returns. The woman and her daughter praise your name. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You nod as the woman explains her daughter&rsquo;s condition, but when she is done you tell her there is an alternative to stealing the egg of the legendary giant bird. &ldquo;Your daughter has a disease,&rdquo; you inform her, &ldquo;Not a curse. If you&rsquo;ll but help me gather a few herbs, I can make a poultice that will cure her just as well as a dose of magic egg yolk. I promise.&rdquo; And just as you have declared, the woman&rsquo;s daughter makes a full recovery! [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
