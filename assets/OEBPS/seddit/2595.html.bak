<p class="TaleDestiny">(2595) - PIETY</p>
<p>As you are traveling along the road, your caravan is set upon by a large lizard. It grabs you and you lose consciousness. When you awaken, you find yourself in a dank cave. As your eyes slowly adjust to the darkness, you see a woman sitting there, also badly hurt. Nearby, a nest of tiny legless lizards hiss and cry for food. Suddenly, the giant monster reappears and begins to move towards the other. You think, &ldquo;This is no way for someone of such beauty to die, so I must give myself first.&rdquo; You throw yourself between the unfortunate woman and the lizard, ready for your fate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Just as you brace for the gnashing of the beast&rsquo;s terrible jaws, there is the sound of clanking metal as guards from your caravan come to rescue you. The beast, startled by the noise, runs to safety. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Your peaceful countenance stills the fire in the beast&rsquo;s eyes. Your faith and sacrifice bless you, and the beast steps aside to let you and the beautiful maiden leave. The maiden, a daughter of the local noble, awards you greatly. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Piety]</p>
