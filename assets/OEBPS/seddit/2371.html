<p class="TaleDestiny">(2371) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You give a performance that would convince a Sultan.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: But suddenly you realize the tables have been turned upon you. Instead of tricking the other into believing your virtue, you are boasting of the most heinous crimes before a crowd of onlookers. You escape before you can be arrested, but you are a wanted, self-confessed criminal. [<span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: The other listens to your tale gravely, but at the end turns an indulgent smile upon you, as a parent smiles upon a precocious child. &ldquo;That was well told, but you still have much to learn.&rdquo; You spend some time with the other learning to craft tales more convincingly by magical means. [Magic]</p>
