<p>The other&rsquo;s disguise fails to fool you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You snatch the other away to a remote locale and rip away his disguise. Once his true identity is revealed, you demand coins to keep your tongue still about his secret. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">OUTLAW  (mandatory):</span> Acting swiftly when opportunity arises, you seize the other. With your underworld connections you are able to deliver him into the hands of another scoundrel more versed in the particulars of the fine art of kidnapping. In exchange, you are given a generous cut of the reward. [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely)]</p>
