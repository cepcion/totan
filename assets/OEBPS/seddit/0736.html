<p class="TaleDestiny">(736) - None</p>
<p>The whirlpool opens beneath the ship&mdash;there is no time to avoid it. At its center is a small gleaming tower of rock, wreathed in a clutter of metal. Could it be magnetic?</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can jettison all things metallic or trust in your abilities to sail on:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you dump your metal</span>: Once free of the magnetic pull, the ship sails away easily. Unfortunately, you lost a great deal of wealth, and the other passengers, disbelieving your story of a &ldquo;magnetic island,&rdquo; consider you feeble-minded. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you sail on, roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Seamanship</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: You try to sail out of the whirlpool, but it is too powerful. The ship is wrecked, and you are cast up on a distant shore. [W-2 (Min: Beggar) / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: You bravely fight against the whirlpool, and finally triumph! You succeed in saving the ship and all who are on it. The other passengers praise you for your supreme skill. [D+2 / S+2 / Seamanship / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
</ul>
