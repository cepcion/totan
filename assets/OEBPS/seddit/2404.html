<p class="TaleDestiny">(2404) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You come across an attractive person beating a dog, who lovingly accepts the harsh treatment. You grab a passerby to ask why no one is stopping this and learn that the dog is actually an &rsquo;efreet who fell in love with the horrid person. To show his love he agreed to transform into a dog, in which form he remains trapped, suffering such treatment as you have witnessed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Despite the &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s willingness, no one should suffer so. You pick up a stick and threaten the person with it&mdash;but the dog comes to her defense. You fend him off with the stick, but the dog proves very strong and you are made to retreat. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You cannot let this suffering go on. With a little water and a few chanted words of power, you are able to restore the dog to his former self. Instead of taking revenge on the person, the &rsquo;efreet again declares undying love&mdash;which the human paramour snubs, storming away. The &rsquo;efreet turns to you with glaring eyes, and with a gesture, sends you sprawling on the ground. &ldquo;Interfere not in matters of the heart!&rdquo; He, too, storms away&mdash;in the other direction. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
