<p class="TaleDestiny">(2075) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You beat the captain fair and square, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from trying to get back the money that you won from him! You know from the moment you leave the tavern that the captain&rsquo;s men are following you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Having prepared your escape route ahead of time, you lead his men on a wild goose chase all over town, eventually walking them into a blind alley that ends at a dirt-covered wall. The day, like the money, is yours! [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You know the town like the back of your hand, and are thus able to lead the captain&rsquo;s men right into a patrol of guards, who promptly give them a sound thrashing. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Luck]</p>
