<p class="TaleDestiny">(1980) - ACCURSED  (M), ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Sailing through an area of open sea, you are surprised when you run aground unexpectedly. As your ship careens, the waters around you bubble and boil. You have struck an underwater volcano! As you struggle to free your vessel, your lookout spies a distant sail.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You manage to signal the other ship, which moves in to help you free your vessel. Fortunately, you clear the sandbar before the new island grows any higher. [S+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED  (mandatory):</span> The other vessel approaches to aid you, but runs aground on the rapidly rising island! Soon both vessels are trapped! The other captain blames you for his misfortune. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The other vessel refuses to risk approaching you, so you are forced to free yourself. As you work, the island rises slowly from the sea, forcing you to struggle even harder. But Allah smiles even on those who suffer: the rising island reveals an enormous emerald!
[D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
