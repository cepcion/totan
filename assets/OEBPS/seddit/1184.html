<p class="TaleDestiny">(1184) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You have come to view that creature of legend&mdash;the elephant. You engage a guide who promises you a glimpse of this marvelous creature.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your guide turns out to be a fraud. He brings you to a band of brigands who rob you completely. [D-1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You quickly realize that your guide is not as skilled as he claimed; you know almost as much about the area as he does.</p>
<p>However, he is not useless: by supplementing your knowledge with his, you manage to find an elephant. Truly it is a magnificent beast! [D+1 / S+2]</p>
