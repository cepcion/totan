<p class="TaleDestiny">(2372) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You hire the other in order to intimidate one who oppressed you in the past.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you conclude the deal, the other turns you into a giant black jinni that you might confront your tormentor. Unfortunately, your voice does not match your stature and the words you speak instill laughter instead of fear. Perhaps you will learn to manipulate your voice to augment your disguise. [D+1 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: As you congratulate yourself on getting the services of the other for a mere pittance, you soon regret your decision as the other displays no skills whatsoever, and he makes a fool of you in front of your oppressor. As you turn to confront the other, you see his double at a merchant&rsquo;s stall! You stride over to the stall and demand to know what is going on. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t expect to hire me personally for the amount you offered, did you? I put a glamour on my slave to portray me in my stead.&rdquo; You are made an even bigger fool&mdash;and to a larger audience. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
