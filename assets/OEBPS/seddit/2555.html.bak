<p class="TaleDestiny">(2555) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>The one you have been pursuing for months is quite fetching. Finally, she relents and promises you her heart, but warns you that her brother, a greatly respected holy man, has sworn never to let his youngest sibling marry without his permission, and his standards are so high that none shall ever meet them. Your lover tells you where to find the brother, and you head out to threaten him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You find the holy man easily. You take him to a secluded alleyway, and by applying a blade to his throat, obtain his promise to bless whomever his sibling loves. After you return to tell your lover the great news, you find her in the arms of another! You were played like a fish on the line.
