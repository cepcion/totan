<p class="TaleDestiny">(2415) - MALE  (M), FEMALE  (M)</p>
<p>In the middle of nowhere, a being of great beauty appears before you. She says she needs your help and points to a small entrance in a cluster of stones. You are sure these rocks were not present seconds ago, and you suspect some mischief.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MALE  (mandatory):</span> You agree to aid on one condition: that you delay no more than an hour as you have pressing business. Once inside her home, she stands revealed as a beautiful &rsquo;efreeteh. She has watched you for many months and has fallen in love with you. The next hour is spent in bliss, your wishes all coming true. When exactly one hour has passed, she points to her door. You say you can stay longer, but she has to honor her word. Nothing you say changes her mind and you leave, though your heart remains behind. [D+1 / S+1 / Seduction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FEMALE  (mandatory):</span> The woman assures you it will be worth your while: you tell her your &ldquo;while&rdquo; is worth a lot. Once inside, the woman reveals herself to one of the People of the Flame and tells you she is in love with your cousin. She promises you a rich reward if you could but introduce her. This seems a small matter and you so agree. The other fills your purses with gold and jewels as advance payment and you promise to fulfill your end of the deal. [W+4 (Max: Princely)]</p>
