<p class="TaleDestiny">(996) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>As you enter the city, a greasy character offers you &ldquo;night passes&rdquo; for a fee. Without them, he explains, you may not travel after dark. You pay, but later learn the passes are frauds. You are determined to regain your money and punish the scoundrel.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait near the gate, hoping to catch sight of the miscreant, but he does not appear. After a few days, pressing business forces you to yield. Your empty pockets haunt you. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Knowing that the villain will be celebrating his crime, you search the taverns and bawdy-houses of the city. The search takes many hours, but you finally come upon the man. You pummel him senseless and recover your money. Truly Allah rewards those who stick to their tasks! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
