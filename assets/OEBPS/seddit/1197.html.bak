<p class="TaleDestiny">(1197) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Prince Taj el Mulouk has learned that his intended love, Princess Dunya, distrusts men on account of a dream she has had. In the dream a male dove failed to rescue a female dove from a fowler&rsquo;s net.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no idea how to disabuse the woman of her odd notions, and you can&rsquo;t help the prince. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You suggest a solution, which the prince turns into a verse: the male dove did not come, for he was slain by a hawk while struggling to return to his love. Dunya reads the verse and is deeply moved. Soon after, Prince Taj asks you to help him approach the Princess to press his suit.
