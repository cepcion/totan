<p class="TaleDestiny">(1780) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Something about your host sets you on edge. He&rsquo;s perfectly polite and pleasant, but you cannot shake this feeling that he is hiding something. That night you decide to explore his hundred-room palace. Finally, you reach the final door.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Throwing open the door, you discover your host in the middle of a blasphemous Magian ritual! You draw your knife and rush forward, but he turns his evil gaze upon you. In a trice, you feel your soul shudder within your body as you lose control of your own actions!
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Peering through the doorway, you see your host conducting a Magian ritual. If you can get close enough, perhaps you can disrupt his vile sorcery. Luck is with you, as you find a discarded Magian robe nearby. Thus disguised, you are able to interrupt their spell by moving their arcane instruments at the right moment. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
