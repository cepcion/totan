<p class="TaleDestiny">(2309) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You decide to take a voyage and encounter the other on the ship. He seems a good candidate for a kidnapping.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you might, you cannot trick the other into showing a weakness. Your attempts are unsuccessful. [Acting and Disguise / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You know that the other will have to attend to a certain area of the ship at some point&mdash;a secluded area. You wait there for the other near the end of the voyage and waylay him. The other is not missed as you cart him off the vessel in a trunk. The ransom is small, but worth your efforts.
