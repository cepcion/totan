<p class="TaleDestiny">(1898) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>If you had known that the other was so near to death, you would not have hired him to deliver such an important message. Now he has expired in the street, and your sensitive letter may fall into the wrong hands.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is no chance to recover your letter before it is found by the guards. Better to make an escape now before they come looking for you. [D+1 / Have another player move you one space in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You approach the guards as they stand around the other. You offer to deal with his remains in exchange for whatever valuables you may find on him. They look at his meager rags and decide that he has nothing they would want, so they agree. You dump the body and retrieve your letter. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
