<p class="TaleDestiny">(2468) - None</p>
<p>You are awoken from your sleep by the sound of a roc flying overhead. Leaping onto your horse, you set out to follow it, and it leads you to its nest and its lone egg. You have heard tales of these dangerous creatures destroying flocks and herds, so you rush to the Sultan to warn him of the danger. He dispatches his army to deal with the beast before the egg can hatch. Impressed by your wisdom, he makes you his trusted advisor. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
