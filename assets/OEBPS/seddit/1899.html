<p class="TaleDestiny">(1899) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>The proud and haughty must, on occasion, be taught humility lest their power should lead them astray. You decide to take that duty on yourself.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, the proud and haughty also tend to attract the weak-willed. You are unable to overcome the other&rsquo;s guardians, and are forced to retreat. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You choose a fine location to catch the other by surprise. Leaping from the shadows, you unleash a flurry of blows upon the other. Though you would have preferred to make an example in public, at least this one knows that all power save Allah&rsquo;s is limited. [D+1]</p>
