<p class="TaleDestiny">(1795) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Entering the strange black pavilion, you are amazed by the wealth and luxuries within. At the center sits a black-skinned giant, sipping at a bowl of wine. At his feet sit a number of wary, suspicious men. &ldquo;Welcome!&rdquo; the giant thunders. &ldquo;We were hoping for another challenger: If you win, a share of my wealth will be yours. If you lose, well, even giants need to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The giant has chosen a test of riddles to see which of you will be released, and which will be his next meal. Many puzzles are solved before the giant is satisfied, and you are chosen the winner!</p>
<p>True to his word, the giant rewards you and lets you go. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, COURTLY GRACES</span>: The giant enjoys fine music, so it is to be a contest of singing and dancing! The other men, bitter and mean, are poor challengers compared to your skill. The giant is charmed and delighted by your talents. He is so enchanted that he refuses to let you go! Still, it is better to be a guest than a meal. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
