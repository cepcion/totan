<p class="TaleDestiny">(881) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You stumble upon a Magian fire-worshipping ceremony. Strange creatures flicker in the flames. The Magians, in their red turbans, turn and gaze upon you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You draw your sword and attack but your trembling hand will not obey. Flaming dogs leap from the fire and overwhelm you. The Magians bind you, toss you into a smoldering coal-pit, and leave you for dead. Only Allah preserves your miserable life. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: In the name of Allah, you draw your sword and lay about mercilessly, though you are outnumbered. Your unceasing attack sends them howling and fleeing in all directions, and the strange fire-beasts scatter into the night. Your great deeds are reported to the Sultan, who showers you with honor. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
