<p class="TaleDestiny">(2513) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>Jailed unjustly, you are finally released. As you depart, you pass a particularly dank and smelly cell. A shape huddled in the darkness crawls forward, squinting into the light. &ldquo;I beg you. Pay for my freedom, and I will reward you with a treasure map.&rdquo; The guards push you along, saying, &ldquo;Ignore that poisoning hussy.&rdquo; You cannot forget the other&rsquo;s words, however: You must get your hands on that map.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You return to the jail and claim that a prisoner stole a map from you. You point to the other as the culprit. The guards search but find nothing. The maiden cackles at your frustration. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You sneak into the jail, bribing the guards to let you pass. Outside the maiden&rsquo;s cell, you whisper heart-felt promises that you will return once you have the money. In the process, you trick her into revealing the map&rsquo;s hiding place. You retrieve it and find the treasure. You travel on, putting your promise to the woman out of your mind. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
