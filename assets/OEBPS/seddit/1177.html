<p class="TaleDestiny">(1177) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>A passing dendan rocks your ship so badly that you are swept over the side. You are desperate with fear, and call out, hoping the merfolk will hear.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You panic, swallowing so much water you can&rsquo;t even cry for help; you grasp a bit of flotsam and drift with it until you are picked up by another ship. [D+1 / Have another player move you to any sea space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You endure the cold water until&mdash;miracle of God!&mdash;the merfolk do arrive and convey you back to the ship. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
