<p class="TaleDestiny">(2059) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You come across a band of brigands engaged in raucous celebration of a recent raid. The wine flows steady and the sounds of their merriment echo across the valley floor. &ldquo;Why the celebration, friends?&rdquo; you inquire. The brigands tell you of their brazen daylight raid on a corrupt merchant who, through unconscionable usury, had drained the poor of both their dignity and their earnings.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although you do not generally drink alcohol, you raise a mug and toast the honor of their deeds. [D+2 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Moved by their conviction, you offer to represent the gang as emissary to the common folk, to spread the word of the brigands&rsquo; heroic deeds in your travels. The gang honors you with a toast and with recitation of an oath of acceptance and respect. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
