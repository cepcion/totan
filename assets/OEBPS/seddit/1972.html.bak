<p>Rumors of pirates have been reaching your ears for some weeks as you make your way through the various islands of this region. Such scallywags cannot be allowed to disrupt the sea lanes, so you take it upon yourself to hunt them down. You finally discover their haven on the slopes of a volcanic island. As you approach the island, smoke begins pouring forth from its highest peak! The volcano is about to erupt!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You know that you must escape the burning ash. Sadly, you see that the pirates have made the same discovery, and you are forced to let them escape. [S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You know that the pirates will probably try to escape from the eruption, and you realize that you have a chance to stop them! In order to escape, the pirates must pass through a narrow strait. If you can block that strait long enough, they will be unable to reach safety in time. But if you wait too long, your ship will be caught in the conflagration!</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding two for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Seamanship</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;4: Fiery rocks begin to rain from the heavens, splattering your deck and setting your sails ablaze! Your boldness has cost you dearly. [S+1 / W-3 (Min: Beggar) / Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">5&ndash;9: The flaming debris from the eruption falls too close for comfort. You are forced to retreat too soon, and the pirates make their escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">10+: The fighting is fierce, but you manage to delay the pirates long enough to hamper their flight. Though your ship is singed, and a couple of the reavers slipped past you, your boldness and determination accomplished much this day. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</li>
