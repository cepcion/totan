<p class="TaleDestiny">(2239) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Enraged by the other&rsquo;s aggressive begging, you decide to press him into service.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You endure the other&rsquo;s terrible service for a short time before waking one morning to find him gone&hellip; along with several of your coins. [W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: The other begrudgingly does your bidding for a time. Not one to be lulled into absent-mindedness, you keep one eye always on the other. You catch him one night trying to slip coins from your purse. With a sound beating, you chase him off. [S+1]</p>
