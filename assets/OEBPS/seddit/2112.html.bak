<p class="TaleDestiny">(2112) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>As you make your way through the mountains, you hear ahead of you a call for help. Rounding the bend, you see before you a plump merchant, apparently pressed against the cliff edge by some invisible force. &ldquo;Help me!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;I will reward you well!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize that this is one of the mysterious Magnetic Mountains that cause so many travelers distress. From a safe distance, you call to the merchant and instruct him that he must cast aside his possessions in order to be free. To your surprise, he refuses. Shaking your head, you leave the greedy man to his fate. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You remember a wise old man who told you of these Magnetic Mountains. He claimed that the oil of the Skordon plant can counteract these powerful invisible forces. By luck, you happen to have a supply on hand. You quickly crush the pungent cloves into oil and pour the oil over the merchant. To his glee, he is free of the magnetic forces, and eagerly presses a bag of gold coins into your hands.
