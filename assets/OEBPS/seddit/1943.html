<p class="TaleDestiny">(1943) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>While you sit outside the palace marveling at the irony of such a beautiful place being ruled by such a fearsome tyrant, you notice a rotund merchant approaching, perched on a tiny donkey.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You strike up a conversation with the jovial merchant, complimenting him on his beautiful robes and silken fez. He agrees to bring you along on his visit to the Crystal Palace while he offers his wares to the king within. Inside the palace your eyes are greeted by wonders beyond your imagining. But the most remarkable thing is what you hear come to pass between the merchant and the king. Why, so skilled is the merchant&rsquo;s tongue that if he were selling bags of desert sand, you&rsquo;d be first in line to buy them at any price! [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You convince the merchant to allow you to accompany him when he visits the Crystal Palace. Once inside, your etiquette and wit impress both the merchant and the wicked king. You are able to negotiate a deal between them, for which you are well rewarded by both parties. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
