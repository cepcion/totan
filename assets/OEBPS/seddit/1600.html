<p class="TaleDestiny">(1600) - BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>Seeing as the &rsquo;efreet is an intelligent being, you hope that with reasonable words and an offer of your help you can turn away the anger of the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The &rsquo;efreet ignores your words as if you were a worm and unleashes just the smallest part of his fury upon you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: Your words penetrate the haze of hatred surrounding the &rsquo;efreet. He listens intently and finally he says, &ldquo;I see that your intentions were not of a malicious nature and therefore I forgive you.&rdquo; The &rsquo;efreet vanishes in a cloud of smoke, leaving you unharmed. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
