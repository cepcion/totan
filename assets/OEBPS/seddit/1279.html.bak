<p class="TaleDestiny">(1279) - STEALTH AND STEALING, CELESTIAL PLANISPHERE</p>
<p>From high atop a tree you watch the high druid, who brings forth a shining sphere. Gazing into it, he pronounces your Sultan&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;That Prince of the Faithful is now dead,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We shall go to his city, and make it ours. Only the power of this sphere could stop us, and it shall be hidden where none can find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You set off at once to warn your people, that they might not fall victim to these foul sorcerers. [D+2 / S+2 / Stealth and Stealing / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You seek the hiding place of the sphere. Snatching it up, you race for your city. [D+2 / S+2 / Celestial Planisphere / Place your Destination marker in Baghdad. When you arrive there, you may give yourself any status]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">CELESTIAL PLANISPHERE</span>: You produce the Celestial Planisphere from your pack and gaze into it to see if the words spoken by the Druid are true. You behold the Sultan, as healthy as a newborn. You hear cries from within the stone circle and look up. The high priest of the druids lies dead on the ground, covered in shattered glass. Praise Allah, his own sphere has exploded, killing him instantly! Thanks to your magic, your Sultan is safe. [D+3 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
