<p class="TaleDestiny">(2570) - WISDOM</p>
<p>During your travels, you have accumulated several belongings. Struggling to carry them, you are approached by a ragged other who offers to help for a few coins. Grateful for the aid, you fail to notice the other&rsquo;s smooth skin and healthy limbs do not match his otherwise destitute air.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other follows you with several of your larger bags. As you pause to enter a shop, he sprints off and is lost in the crowd.
[S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: As you hand over your belongings, you notice the other&rsquo;s hands are insufficiently rough for a day laborer. You arrange your movement about the city to follow a patrol of watchmen. When the disguised thief makes his move, you are ready and shout for the guards. They apprehend the trickster and inform you a reward has been offered for this man. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
