<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE, STEALTH AND STEALING  (mandatory):</span> You catch him sneaking out one night and give him a beating he&rsquo;ll never forget. He is resentful, but no longer tries to escape. You hear him muttering curses under his breath. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
