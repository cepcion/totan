<p class="TaleDestiny">(1576) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You carefully examine your surroundings after the jailor leaves. You find a colony of ants living in the dirt walls of your cell.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, you are much larger than an ant, and cannot make use of their tunnels to free yourself. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You spend hours watching the ants, and realize that the colony is immense, and its tunnels are extensive. You strike the wall, and it collapses under your blows; soon, you have tunneled your way to freedom (though you have suffered some stings along the way). [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> (1 turn) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
