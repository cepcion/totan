<p class="TaleDestiny">(2284) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Your attempt to punish other is easily thwarted.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the other has you at his mercy, you are beaten and tortured until he has satisfied his wicked desires. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other has the best of you with words, but you are sure to get the best of him with the blade. You attack with great skill, but you quickly realize that you are facing your equal (or perhaps superior), so you hastily withdraw. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
