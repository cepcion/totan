<p class="TaleDestiny">(325) - PIETY</p>
<p>Before you can even move, the other attacks you like a man possessed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You flee, but he pursues. As you pull away, he shouts. &ldquo;I shall follow ye to the ends of the earth!&rdquo; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Only by the will of Allah can you be saved! You fall to your knees and cry out. Your attacker seems dazed, and clutches at his eyes. &ldquo;I am blinded!&rdquo; he cries. Thus is revealed again the power of the True Faith, and the good fortune with which the Living God blesses His followers.
[D+2 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
