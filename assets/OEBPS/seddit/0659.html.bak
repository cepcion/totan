<p class="TaleDestiny">(659) - BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, ENSLAVED  (M)</p>
<p>At your cry the surface of the water boils. Suddenly an enormous
&rsquo;efreet bursts from the water. &ldquo;Who summons me!?&rdquo; he roars.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Timidly, you croak, &ldquo;Me??&rdquo; This does not impress him. The last thing you remember is a burst of light&hellip; [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You abase yourself before the
&rsquo;efreet, saying, &ldquo;Most marvelous is the tale I hear (and scarcely can I credit it, so incredible is it) that one of your size and power can fit into a tiny lamp&hellip;&rdquo; Haughtily, but none too cleverly, the &rsquo;efreet demonstrates.
[D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / Magic Lamp]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENSLAVED  (mandatory):</span> Your master, who has brought you to this place, replies, &ldquo;It was this slave, who will serve you to the end of his days, in recompense for this outrage, O mightiest of &rsquo;efreeti.&rdquo; Your master pauses, in thought. &ldquo;Since, however, this slave&rsquo;s temerity has brought us together, perhaps we can discuss matters of mutual advantage&hellip;&rdquo; You spend the rest of your days fetching and carrying for the &rsquo;efreet, performing the daily housekeeping of the lamp, and so on. Your captor&rsquo;s magical prowess makes it impossible to escape, making the rest of your drab life a tale that is of interest only to those who would learn from its mistakes, and when finally you are released from servitude, it is only by the Host of Graveyards.
