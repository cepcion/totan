<p class="TaleDestiny">(2583) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Traveling through a small village, you find yourself quickly surrounded it by ragged children begging for handouts. You dig into your purse to find a few small coins, when you are approached by a group of dervishes. The leader says, &ldquo;Allah blesses those who practice charity.&rdquo; You feel you understand his hint, and give the alms to the dervishes instead.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The leader is amused. &ldquo;No man, no matter how holy he may claim to be, has greater claim to charity than a hungry child.&rdquo; The dervishes hand your coins directly to the children, who race off in every direction. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You say, &ldquo;I know that you have foresworn all luxuries, but you know this land and its people far better than I do. Please guide my gifts to those who are most in need.&rdquo; The leader is very pleased by your gesture, and gives half the coins to the children around. &ldquo;The rest,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;will go to the sick and the elderly, in your name.&rdquo; [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
