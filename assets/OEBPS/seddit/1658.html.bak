<p class="TaleDestiny">(1658) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>A traveling shop has come to town, bringing with it all manner of exotic delights and fetishes. All the people of the town begin to spend their money with wild abandon, giving little thought to whether they can afford it or not.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You purchase a variety of fineries, haggling down all the prices. The bazaar packs up in the dark of the night, and when morning comes, you find all the &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; were dross and driftwood, enchanted to seem wondrous. You have been tricked into spending nearly all your money. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You have read about this strange bazaar, where the mystical merchants utterly destroy a town by taking all of its wealth. You have also read that what they sell is mere trash, but they have such skill that it all appears to be treasures. Though it is hard to resist purchasing anything, you manage to set the bazaar aflame, ending the spell. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
