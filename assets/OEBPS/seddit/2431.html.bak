<p>At first, you dismissed the hushed tales of a haunted well near the village. But you have heard it said so many times that you decide you must investigate it for yourself. Hiding a safe distance away, you watch the well with great curiosity.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You discover that it is no ghost that haunts this well, but some horrific monster: half-man and half-snake! You have no choice but to warn the villagers away from the well and send word to the Sultan of this hideous beast. [S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You are amazed to realize that the creature haunting the well is in reality a noble Nagah, far from its home in the lands of the Mughals. They are attracted to deep water and often make their homes in wells or pools. You approach the creature, and convince him to move to a more remote location, that the villagers might no longer trouble him in his hermitage. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
