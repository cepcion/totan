<p class="TaleDestiny">(2050) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>As you draw near, you find the brigands enmeshed in a bitter dispute over which brigand&rsquo;s legacy is greatest; whose blade is fastest, whose name strikes the greatest fear into the hearts of the wealthy and corrupt. Viewing your timely arrival as a sign of Fate, the brigands immediately demand that you settle the matter.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In order for you to know who is greatest, you reason, you must witness each brigand&rsquo;s prowess first-hand. You make them spend the evening engaged in trials of speed, swordsmanship, and savagery, all designed to set brigand against brigand. When the last of the trials concludes, you render your verdict&mdash;which immediately enrages all those who felt they should win but did not. The brigands chase you from their camp, cursing your name and shouting threats of violent revenge. [S+2 / Bargaining and Evaluation / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Pulling out your parchment and your quills, you offer to immortalize the story of the entire gang&rsquo;s many, thrilling exploits. You spend the evening hearing testimonials around a fire, and come morning the brigands leave you to the business of transforming their deeds into the stuff of legend.
