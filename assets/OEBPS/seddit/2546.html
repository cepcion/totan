<p class="TaleDestiny">(2546) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You are approached by a dark stranger bearing the royal sigil of the prince of this land. It seems that the prince&rsquo;s favorite wine-merchant has been kidnapped and taken to an old mosque hidden in the mountains. The stranger asks that you retrieve him. When you arrive at the distant valley, you find the merchant sitting among a dozen holy men. Seeing your bewilderment, the other tells you that he fled his old vocation to follow Allah&rsquo;s calling.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have promised the prince that you will bring the man back. When he refuses to come along, you toss a sack over his head. He has responsibilities, and you do not have the right to forgive him of them. [S+2 / Lose Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You make the man an offer. In exchange for his return with you, you will act as advocate for his religious calling. He reluctantly follows you, but when you arrive, he is immediately locked away for betraying the prince&rsquo;s service. A courtier hands you your reward and thanks you for your assistance. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
