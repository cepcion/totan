<p class="TaleDestiny">(375) - PIETY</p>
<p>Success beyond your wildest dreams! As you search in the other&rsquo;s yard, you happen to find a hidden trapdoor which leads to a vast underground chamber filled with wealth!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Praise Allah for His bounty! [D+1 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You note that the chamber has long been unused, and you suspect that the owner of the house is unaware of its existence. You recall the words of the Prophet concerning greed, and know that wealth will avail you not when comes the Terminator of Earthly Delights. You go to the owner of the house and explain what you have found. The other is amazed at your honesty, and shares the wealth with you. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
