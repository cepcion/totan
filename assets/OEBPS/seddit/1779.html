<p class="TaleDestiny">(1779) - None</p>
<p>A bird lands on your shoulder, graspng a tiny note in its beak. &ldquo;I am in the Palace of 100 Closets. Help me!&rdquo; the note reads. Someone is imprisoned and in need of your aid!</p>
<p>You arrive at the palace and demand to see the one who wrote the note. The confused owners agree to show you around the palace, opening the doors to 99 rooms. But they refuse to open the hundredth. Drawing your blade, you threaten life and limb unless they open the final room. Reluctantly, they obey, and in the chamber beyond you find their daughter. She is so beautiful that all who gaze upon her are enraptured and refuse to leave the palace! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</p>
