<p class="TaleDestiny">(1110) - WEALTH: POOR or less (M), WISDOM</p>
<p>A dervish promises you &ldquo;great wealth&rdquo; if you accompany him. He leads you to a hidden oasis and points to a large dune. There, at the top, is a fabulous array of jewels, gold, and gems. &ldquo;It could be yours,&rdquo; he whispers.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEALTH: POOR or less (mandatory):</span> You rush forward, your heart consumed by greed. As you climb the dune, it collapses on you, burying you and toppling the chest down the far side. You hear the dervish laughing as you extricate yourself, but when you are free, he is long gone with all the goods. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The dervish would not have shown you this were it easy to take. You ignore his whispers, and fill your eyes with the beauty of the treasure. The dervish is furious, and eventually storms off. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
