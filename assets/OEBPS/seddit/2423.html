<p class="TaleDestiny">(2423) - PIETY  (M)</p>
<p>At night, your camp is overcome by an enormous cloud of screeching, flapping bats. Fearing for your life and unable to find cover, you dive to the ground and pray for deliverance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After being buffeted about for what feels like forever, the cloud of bats disappears as mysteriously as it arrived. Much of your camp has been destroyed, but at least you are alive. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> Confident that Allah would never let one as devout as you come to harm, you stand up among the bats, ignoring their many bites and cuts. You survive, but some of the bites are very slow to heal. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
