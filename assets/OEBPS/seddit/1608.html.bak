<p>The other is of terrible mien and fouler temper, and has accused you of terrible blasphemies against his people.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are unable to defend yourself against the charges, especially from such an august personage. You accept his judgment for your crimes. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You throw yourself on his mercy, saying that you know of no such blasphemy that you have committed, but will gladly help donate to the cause of spreading the word of Allah. In response to your open repentance, the other has no choice but to forgive you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
