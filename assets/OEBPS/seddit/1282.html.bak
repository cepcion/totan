<p class="TaleDestiny">(1282) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, ENVIOUS  (M)</p>
<p>The cave wall slides aside, revealing a huge black &rsquo;efreet. &ldquo;You may only stay within for half an hour,&rdquo; he intones,&rdquo; and bring 1000 dinars out for me.&rdquo; You find the jewel room, but you also find a room where 100 people are chained to a wall! &ldquo;Free us,&rdquo; they cry. Time is short. Free the people? Or gather jewels to appease the &rsquo;efreet?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After much struggle, you free few, then, time grown short, you rush out with the jewels. The ones you abandoned call curses after you. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Forsaking your chance to escape, you free first one prisoner, then another, and direct them until all are freed. As the chains fall from the last, he cries, &ldquo;The curse is broken!&rdquo; At that, the cave becomes a fabulous palace! &ldquo;This kingdom is yours!&rdquo; cries an elderly scholar. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> Your decision is simple: you stuff your pockets with jewels of fabulous worth, then interrogate the prisoners as to the location of greater treasures, and, luckily, a mule-drawn cart. You load fistfuls of egg-sized pearls, rubies the size of peaches, and other booty onto the sturdy cart, forgetting the &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s admonition until he looms before you. &ldquo;Greedy Mortal, as are all your kind: I have come for you. You have overstayed your welcome, and so must now dwell here forever!&rdquo; A hand the size of a saddle strikes you down and makes you fast next to the rest of the prisoners, as the &rsquo;efreet complains, &ldquo;Each one of you that I add to my collection makes it less likely that some fool will stay to free you all! Each day the chances of your escape dwindle! Fools! Must I imprison every Son of Adam before I may quit my duty?&rdquo;
