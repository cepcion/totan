<p class="TaleDestiny">(2433) - LUCK, WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>For three nights you have pursued a beast so black you can see it only when you are not looking directly at it. You resolve to capture the creature that you might learn more about it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You lure the beast into a secluded canyon from which there is no exit. But when you reach the end, the creature has vanished! Shaken by your brush with the supernatural, you hastily flee. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You trick the beast by not pursuing it, luring it closer and closer to your fire. When it draws too close, you leap upon it and bind it with your rope! It is like a cat with shimmering black fur, and such a curious creature will surely fetch a fine price to a collector. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
