<p>Your swift attack lays the other at your feet before onlookers can react. Guards for the Sultan are on hand, and take you into custody, demanding to know the reason for your action.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your protests that the other radiated &ldquo;an aura of evil&rdquo; are considered without merit, and you are imprisoned, as is only right. [S+1 /<span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACE, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You vigorously defend your actions. Your impassioned and skillful rhetoric soon convinces the court that the other was an old enemy of yours who slew your parents and abducted your sister. You are awarded the possessions he was carrying, and are let free. [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> You vigorously defend your actions. Your impassioned and skillful rhetoric soon convinces the court that the other was an old enemy of yours who slew your parents and abducted your sister. You produce as further evidence the Brass Trumpet, which sounded when you approached the other, sure proof of his evil intent. You are let free. [D+1 / S+2 / Wisdom]
