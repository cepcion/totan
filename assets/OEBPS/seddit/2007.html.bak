<p class="TaleDestiny">(2007) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Someone stokes your fire during the night and disturbs your rest. A well-dressed, apparently cultured gooleh bids you a fine evening. Thinking quickly, you engage the gooleh in conversation, praising her sharp fangs and pale flesh. She calmly describes her malign intentions and seems to take some delight in the horrors she will inflict upon you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your bile rises as panic takes control. Dashing off into the night upon terror-strengthened legs, you escape. The monster&rsquo;s braying laugh echoes in your ears for days. [S+2 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, QUICK THINKING</span>: Despite the provocation, you remain calm. Amused by your self-control, the fiend allows herself to be drawn into an extended discussion. In time, you explain that while you would be honored to be consumed by one so sophisticated, the esteemed gooleh would be better served by visiting a group of much plumper (and no-doubt much more tender) infidels who can be found nearby. Thanking you for your pleasantness and recommendation, the monster departs. [D+2 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
