<p class="TaleDestiny">(1846) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You find a crippled huntsman leaning against a tree. He tells you of his encounter with a ferocious rhinoceros. Though he is no longer able to hunt, he is determined to get his revenge on the creature that left him crippled. He has devised a trap for the animal, but he needs someone to lure it in.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to lure the great beast into the trap with noises and gestures, but it seems too cunning to fall for your ruse. Frustrated by your failure, you return to the huntsman, but he has succumbed to his wounds. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
