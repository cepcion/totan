<p class="TaleDestiny">(2142) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>As sand from a fierce sandstorm overwhelms you, you blindly seek shelter, and by luck you find something. When the storm is over you realize you are in a strange, old city.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is no one around. The eerie silence is unnerving and you decide to leave&mdash;but not before taking souvenirs as proof of your visit. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: There is no one around as you explore. You notice that the materials used on the buildings are of a kind you are not familiar with. From a nearby building you chip off a chunk as large as your head and leave the city. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely)]</p>
