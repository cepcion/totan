<p class="TaleDestiny">(273) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You make a very favorable first impression on the other, and he invites you to dine with him. When the plates of food are brought out, they are empty! &ldquo;Do you enjoy my fine cuisine?&rdquo; he asks a little later, after &ldquo;eating&rdquo; a huge meal.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are totally baffled by his behavior, think him mad, and politely excuse yourself. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You fall in with his play-acting, pretending to also enjoy the meal. The joke goes on long enough, however, and finally you leap up and give him a tremendous bash on the neck. &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Why, there was a large bug crawling on you,&rdquo; you reply. He is delighted that you were willing to share his eccentricity and orders real (and sumptuous) food. Then he begs you to remain as his companion for a while, playing all nature of tricks and devices. [D+1 / S+2 / Beguiling]
