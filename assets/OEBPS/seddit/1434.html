<p class="TaleDestiny">(1434) - FATED  (M)</p>
<p>You see anger in the face of the other, and rather than suffer his wrath, you flee from his sight. The next place you go, however, he is there before you! This happens again and again.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fear trickles like ice down your back, and you beg him to stop haunting you. The other looks surprised, and says he has no knowledge of you. &ldquo;There is only one answer. I am drawn to those who are wretched and accursed; that must be your case. I will take note of you, and not see you again.&rdquo; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED  (mandatory):</span> You recognize this as the will of Allah, and speak to the other. &ldquo;Fate has cast us together, so let us make the most of it.&rdquo; The other is most amused by your words; you tell stories to each other long into the night, and when you part, you have gained great insight into the realms of the &rsquo;efreets. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom / Magic / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
