<p class="TaleDestiny">(1386) - None</p>
<p>You thought you knew the route, but things have changed since last you passed this way. Soon you are all lost. The mendicants don&rsquo;t seem to mind, and take the opportunity to explain how they were blinded&mdash;the first by brigands, the second by a Sultan, and the last through greedy use of a magic kohl pot. He gives you the pot, with the admonishment not to use it on both eyes. They quickly walk away, leaving you lost. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Kohl Pot]</p>
