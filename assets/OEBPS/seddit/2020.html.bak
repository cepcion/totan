<p class="TaleDestiny">(2020) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>A shuffling sound disturbs your rest. You depart your campsite carefully, heading toward the noise. You discover a band of gools and gooleh, moving dissolutely through the night. They are weary and melancholy.</p>
<p>It is apparent that they have not fed for some time. Having heard that the area was suffering from depredations by flesh-eaters in the area, you decide to follow to see where they are heading.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fearful that you will be caught and consumed, you give the pack too much of a lead. You lose their trail in the darkness. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: So astute are you in the wild that you return to your camp, pack your belongings, and still catch up with the monsters, tailing them for miles without their knowledge. They wind through difficult terrain and finally arrive at a large camp filled with their ilk. You hurry silently to the nearest town, returning with a troop of soldiers to slaughter the abominations. [D+2 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
