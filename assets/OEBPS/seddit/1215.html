<p>In this magical place is a hall full of closets. You open the doors in turn: behind each is a treasure more fabulous than the last! When you reach the one-hundredth door, you cannot imagine what lies beyond. You open it; inside is a huge &rsquo;efreet, who roars out, &ldquo;I have been imprisoned by my children, and my possessions taken! Now I want them back!&rdquo; He gestures and all is gone, including the palace. One item only remains at your feet.
