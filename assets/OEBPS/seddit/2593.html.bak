<p class="TaleDestiny">(2593) - QUICK THINKING, PIETY</p>
<p>You pause for the night at a local inn, exhausted from your long travels and grateful to be out of the wind. The food is good and the room is awash in beautiful young women. However, you notice throughout the evening that men come and go, staying in back rooms and not eating. After seeing some of the women escort a couple of men into hidden rooms, you realize that you have stumbled into a pagan brothel! You try to leave casually, but one of the women&mdash;half a head taller than you and as fierce as one of the Amazons of legend&mdash;stands before you demanding payment.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You turn as if to go back in, and then with a burst of speed you shove past the woman and flee as quickly as your limbs will carry you. [D+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, PIETY</span>: With surprising speed, you knock down the guard and grab a large sack sitting by her feet. Once safely away, you discover it is full of the ill-gotten gains of the brothel. You donate it to a local mosque. [S+2 / Piety]</p>
