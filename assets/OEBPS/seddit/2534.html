<p class="TaleDestiny">(2534) - WILDERNESS LORE, PIETY</p>
<p>The burning sun hammers against your skin as you cross the desert. You come across a small oasis and are enchanted by the clear waters. Just as you are about to drink, the other comes into view and says, &ldquo;This pool is cursed. My caravan stopped here months ago for refreshment and I am the only survivor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Respectful but disbelieving, you respond, &ldquo;I am grateful for your service, but surely you are mistaken. The waters look harmless.&rdquo; You drink deeply and move along. Over the next few days, however, you become more and more paranoid. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You pause and notice that the pool is surrounded by a rare herb that brings delusion and madness! The roots of the purple-flowered plant reach deep into the watery pool. You bow down to the merchant and praise his service, offering some of your scant supply of clean water. He accepts gratefully. Now that you have pointed it out, he recognizes the herb, and knows a fistful of it will bring a great price in the nearest town. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You respect this wretch&rsquo;s sense of duty to others. &ldquo;Praise Allah for your service.&rdquo; You kneel down to pray, then offer the man a drink from your own nearly-empty water skin. When you rise to leave, he reaches into his robes and produces a strange powder. &ldquo;It comes from the plant that poisons the water. Use it wisely,&rdquo; he says. [D+2 / Yellow Kohl]</p>
