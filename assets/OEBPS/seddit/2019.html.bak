<p>As you travel, you hear a mournful sound from over the next rise. Moving carefully, you see a wretched gooleh sobbing into her hands. A boy, dead and half-eaten, lies before her. Despite your fatigue and debilitations, you confront the beast, raging against her murder.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: So ashamed is she at her deeds that she runs off into the brush. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">CRIPPLED, WOUNDED  (All mandatory)</span>: Noting your condition as well as your passion, the monster&rsquo;s sorrow is magnified. &ldquo;I am not fit to live,&rdquo; she cries. &ldquo;Allah take me now!&rdquo; She seizes a nearby dagger and plunges it through her heart. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
