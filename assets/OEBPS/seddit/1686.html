<p class="TaleDestiny">(1686) - WISDOM</p>
<p>On a street corner, one great in learning stands and begs passers-by for the truth. You offer him a riddle about truth: &ldquo;There stand before you two jinn. One always tells the truth, and the other always lies. You have need of them to answer a question, but you can only ask them each one question, so you will need to figure out which one is which on the first question. What should you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is baffled. He asks you what the answer is, and you reply that you do not know either, that&rsquo;s why you asked him. The crowd around you laughs and you go on your way. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The philosopher does not know the answer. &ldquo;You should ask one what the other will say and realize that whatever answer you receive will be the opposite of the truth.&rdquo; The other is delighted by this riddle and talks with you long into the night. [S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
