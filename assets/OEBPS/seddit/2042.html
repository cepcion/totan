<p class="TaleDestiny">(2042) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>After many days of travel through the desert, you come to a lovely oasis. The vegetation is lush, the waters clear and cool. As you bend to drink, you spy a silver chest below the surface. After slaking your thirst, you succumb to your curiosity and retrieve the shiny box. When you open it, a cloud of purple vapor rises, coalescing into a vague human form. &ldquo;Ah dearest savior, I have waited so many years for you to attend me.&rdquo; The smoke solidifies into a beauteous being&mdash;the one you have longed for these many years.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although you do all in your power to please the other, your efforts are halting and insecure. After one night of frustration, the dreamlike being departs. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You give the object of your desire great pleasure, and receive that ecstasy doubled in return. In the morning, the other is gone but you have been transformed by your bliss. [D+2 / S+1 / Appearance]</p>
