<p class="TaleDestiny">(337) - MAGIC</p>
<p>The other you have addressed laughs and he agrees to aid you.&ldquo;Here is a little charm I picked up somewhere&hellip;&rdquo; You are surprised as he mutters a powerful word. There is a loud *poof* and you feel&hellip; different.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he murmurs. &ldquo;I must study that enchantment further.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You are changed to the opposite sex! Quickly, you undo the charm with a powerful spell of your own, and the other is abashed, saying, &ldquo;That was not the enchantment I intended.&rdquo; You are not so sure. Fearing your power, the other is effusive in his apologies, and presses gifts into your hands to dispel your wrath. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Treasure]</p>
