<p class="TaleDestiny">(1046) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Your ship has been menaced by the dendan in these waters. While watching for them, you spot a merman, who waves both arms in an unmistakable request for help. The captain, Nur-al-Din, wants to kill him &mdash; &ldquo;The filthy infidel!&rdquo; You beg to speak with him first.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You convince Nur-al-Din to give you a few minutes. When you speak with the merman, you realize he is a Muslim! How fortunate you didn&rsquo;t harm him. He tells you how to avoid dendans, and your ship sails on unmolested. [D+2 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
