<p class="TaleDestiny">(2599) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You chance upon a fine steed mired in a pit of mud. Despite your best efforts, you cannot free the animal without aid. You pray to the Most Merciful that you can return in time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fortunately, you encounter a ferryman nearby. With his knowledge of ropes and tack, you are able to free the animal together.
[D+1 / Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: After searching in vain for an hour for anyone to aid you, it is clear that you will not have enough time. Rather than let the creature die, you risk summoning a tiny jinni to help you. He is impressed by your generosity, and declares that henceforth your nobility of spirit shall be clear for all to see. [D+1 / S+1 / Appearance]</p>
