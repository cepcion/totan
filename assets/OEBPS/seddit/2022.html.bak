<p>Wandering through a town market, you notice a cloaked figure moving swiftly, head bowed. As the creature pulls its hood lower, you spy a gnarled, gray-skinned hand. It&rsquo;s a gooleh! You follow, noting that the monster seems to be searching for something or someone. In time, she finds a group of resting city watchmen, separated from the throngs by a cart stacked high with rugs. She accosts the guards, and they leap back, drawing their weapons.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The gooleh appears to be trying to explain something to the soldiers but they will have no part of it. They stab her again and again with their spears. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Something about the gooleh&rsquo;s manner intrigues you. Stepping between the spearmen and the monster, you hold up your arms. &ldquo;Let her speak! Clearly she is distraught at something. So disturbed is she that she would converse with enemies superior in numbers and armaments. I, for one, am curious as to her motives.&rdquo; The guards pause enough to her the gooleh&rsquo;s tale of woe. Her mate was killed by the scouts of a bandit army, sent to test this town&rsquo;s defenses. She seeks revenge and urges the watchmen to report the incursion. So warned, the town mobilizes and strikes down the outlaws. The gooleh escapes in the turmoil. The town headman stages an elaborate ceremony in your honor. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
