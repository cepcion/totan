<p class="TaleDestiny">(2049) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The gang of brigands parts before the confident stride of its leader, who emerges from among his cohort to face you. He says nothing, but simply stands and stares expectantly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unsure as to how best to honor the brigand, you decide to offer a deep bow with a great flourish of the arm for added effect. This offends the criminal leader greatly, and he responds by severing the offending arm with his scimitar and replacing it with a tin hook. He then returns your bow and takes his leave. [D+1 / S+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize this particular band of brutes from your studies, and seem to recall that the gang responds favorably to protracted displays of groveling. You throw yourself at the brigand leader&rsquo;s feet, and one protracted display of groveling later, you are returned to your travels unharmed, and with a purseful of silver to show for your timely humility! [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
