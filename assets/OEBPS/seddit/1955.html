<p class="TaleDestiny">(1955) - LUCK</p>
<p>Having learned the location of the fabled Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard, you approach the Sultan. Without his permission, you cannot hope to retrieve the valuable ivory.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Sultan has too many concerns to aid you in your endeavors, and you get the feeling that he does not believe your tale. However, he does agree to allow you to retrieve the ivory from his lands in exchange for half of what you find. You hire some men to help you, and return a week later with a good supply of the beautiful material. True to his word, the Sultan allows you half of the ivory. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1

<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The Sultan&rsquo;s only son is entranced by your story of danger and great wealth. He begs his father to allow him to lead an expedition to the Elephantâ€˜s Graveyard. Reluctantly, the Sultan agrees. Protected by the prince&rsquo;s own bodyguard and retinue, you have little difficulty traveling to the Graveyard and back with a wagonload of precious ivory. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)]</p>
