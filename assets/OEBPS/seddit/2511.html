<p class="TaleDestiny">(2511) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Sitting on the shore of a beautiful lake, you espy a gold-embossed, ivory-bound codex of the Koran floating in the water. You look left and right and, seeing no one, place the beautiful book in your sack. You quickly gather your things. As you walk away, you hear shouts of &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; from behind you&mdash;an obviously poor man is approaching!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Ashamed, you return the book to the other. He admonishes you, explaining that he is on pilgrimage, and plans to place this exquisite book in the sacred dome at Mecca. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: As the man gets closer, you throw yourself at his feet. &ldquo;I had feared the book&rsquo;s true owner had come to ill end and I was desperate to return it to the mosque. But praise Allah that you are alive!&rdquo; The red-faced man apologizes for his mistake, and offers you his only remaining possession as a reward. [S+2 / Lose Piety / Copper Drum]</p>
