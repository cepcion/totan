<p class="TaleDestiny">(2466) - DETERMINED  (M)</p>
<p>The visage of the other is almost too much to bear. It&rsquo;s all you can do not to run away screaming&mdash;but the screams of the others nearby keep you rooted in place.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You remain rooted there until it is too late to be useful. You resolve never to hesitate like that in the future. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory):</span> As though you have leaden boots on your feet, you slowly and deliberately step forward, reaching out to the other victims until you touch skin. The spell is broken and suddenly you move like a flash of lightning, grabbing up people and getting them to safety. [D+2 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
