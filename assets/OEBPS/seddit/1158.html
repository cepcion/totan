<p class="TaleDestiny">(1158) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>On Ape Island, you devise a scheme to aid the city dwellers: during the day they will build giant &ldquo;scarecrows&rdquo; and, at dusk, put them at the edges of the city to scare the apes away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Much gold and time is spent constructing the dummies, but alas, the apes are not frightened. They destroy the scarecrows and continue their rampage. The people are furious at you, and you wisely travel on. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You survey the scarecrows and feel an additional touch is needed. Ah! You tell the people to set fire to the dummies, and the apparitions blazing through the night succeed in scaring away the apes for good. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
