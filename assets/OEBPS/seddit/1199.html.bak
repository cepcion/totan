<p class="TaleDestiny">(1199) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Prince Taj el Mulouk has secretly entered the palace of the King of the Camphor Isles to profess his love to Princess Dunya. The two lovers are discovered by the king, and the headsman is summoned. You declare yourself their advocate and undertake to argue their case.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Sultan believes Prince Taj is a commoner, and Taj (wishing Dunya to love him as a man) will not declare his noble birth. After the trial, he is banished and returns to his father&rsquo;s palace. So great is his sorrow that it afflicts you, as well. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You hurry to the prince&rsquo;s father, who arrives in haste with his armies. He proclaims Taj his son, the two kings confer, and a magnificent wedding is undertaken. In gratitude, the couple make you a Vizier over a small province. [D+3 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span> / Go to paragraph <a href="1200.html#TaleHeader">1200</a>]</p>
