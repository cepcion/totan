<p class="TaleDestiny">(1672) - WILDERNESS LORE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>Twisting sand storms conceal your path through the desert, and you become lost. Thirsty and sunburnt, you crawl over a dune and tumble into a lush oasis filled with greenery, the air drenched with moisture. You hurry to the nearest stream and gulp down as much water as you can. You awaken a jinni sleeping in the water, and the other rears up, irate for his home being defiled. You offer him praises and gold as penance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The jinni cares not for your praises, and casts you out into the desert again. When you look around back, the oasis is nowhere to be seen. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: The jinni is not amused, but allows you to slake your thirst before leaving his home. You wisely take as much water as you can before setting back off into the desert. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Rich)]</p>
