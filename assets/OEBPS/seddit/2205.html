<p class="TaleDestiny">(2205) - WISDOM, ACTING AND DISGUISE, DETERMINED  (M),  LUCK, SEDUCTION (if opposite sex)</p>
<p>Your discovery of the great riches of the other&rsquo;s household motivates you to plan a kidnapping.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It turns out to be an easy matter to abduct the other&mdash;but getting money for the other is another matter. The other tells you that you have accomplished what members of the household wished for. This angers you, and together you plot to abscond with the household riches using the other&rsquo;s knowledge of secret ways into the house. [D+1 / W+3
(Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The deed is done, but what&rsquo;s this? You notice some mannerisms on your victim not seen before. You discover him to be an imposter, a decoy&mdash;a double! You will not receive any money today and must quickly leave the city. [Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  LUCK</span>: The other turns out to have a gambling problem, so your plan will now be less risky. You are able to get into the graces of people he gambles with and with a few hours, you have taken a fortune from him! [W+4 (Max: Princely) / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION (if opposite sex)</span>: Why kidnap when you can seduce? You work your way into the other&rsquo;s favor. Soon you are married; you share in the other&rsquo;s wealth quite legally and want for nothing. [S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</p>
