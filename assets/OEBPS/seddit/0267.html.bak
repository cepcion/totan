<p>After you finish speaking, the other responds, &ldquo;You have made your wishes clear to me. If you aid me in my search for justice, I shall consider what you ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: <span class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Quick Thinking</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Seduction</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: You lack the necessary skills to aid the other, and he goes on his way. [D+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: With your help, the other brings a foul miscreant to his just end. The other is now free to spend time with you and learn of your charming personality. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if appropriate)]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other is so taken with you that he soon forgets vengeance and returns your attentions wholeheartedly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If the other is of the same sex as you, or if you are Married</span>: You and he spend many nights in pleasant discourse, and each grow wiser from the company of the other. [D+2 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If the other is of opposite sex and is female</span>: With the stain of vengeance cleared from her visage, she shines in beauty, and her kiss is sweeter than the wines of Greece. [D+2 / Seduction / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If the other is of opposite sex and is male</span>: Now that hatred no longer furrows his brow, you see that he is handsome as a prince of Samarkand, and his touch is as strong as Damascus steel. [D+2 / Seduction / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
