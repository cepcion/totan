<p>According to the local villagers, there is a stretch of river nearby where the fabled rhinoceros can often be found drinking and bathing. Intrigued by the tales you have heard about this animal, you decide to investigate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You approach the river bank but slip and splash noisily into the water. The rhino is startled by your noise and immediately charges you! Fortunately for you, the animal has poor eyesight, and after knocking you unconscious, it apparently cannot find you to inflict any more damage. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Cautiously, you approach the mysterious animal. You have heard that it has acute hearing but poor vision. Apparently, the tales are true, as you are able to approach close enough to touch its thick, leathery hide unnoticed. You praise the Creator that can design such fascinating creatures, and thank Him for giving you an opportunity to see one yourself. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
