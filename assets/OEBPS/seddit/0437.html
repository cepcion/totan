<p class="TaleDestiny">(437) - SEDUCTION, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>The other looks upon you sadly. &ldquo;It is not permitted that I love a mortal.&rdquo;</p> 
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no way to answer this. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; says the other.
[D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION, APPEARANCE</span>: Despite his curse, he cannot contain his love for you, and soon you find yourself in the most compromising of positions with him. The other&rsquo;s arcane lore complements your knowledge of the arts amorous, and you spend a day and a night seeking new knowledge in each other&rsquo;s company. Finally, with tears you go your separate ways, as you know must be. He showers you with blessings before you go. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
