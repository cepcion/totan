<p class="TaleDestiny">(1813) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The pillars of the crumbling marble structure were carved in the image of great serpents. But rumors of great wealth within spur you to explore its shadowy depths. As you enter, you are startled by the sudden appearance of a beautiful woman, dressed in a long gray gown.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are entranced by the stately woman, who lures you deeper into the ancient ruin. As you sit together, drinking, you become aware of a serpentine form wrapping itself around you. Your eyes follow the curve of the snake&rsquo;s tail. To your horror, you realize that the woman is transforming into an enormous serpent! Your screams echo off the marble walls as you flee into the forest in blind panic.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: With great respect, you treat the matronly woman as though she were an important official. She seems pleased with your manners and reveals that she is the last of a race of shape-shifting serpents! Your mind reels from her words. Before she allows you to depart, she grants you the gift of ancient scrolls of serpentine wisdom.
