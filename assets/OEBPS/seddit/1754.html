<p class="TaleDestiny">(1754) - None</p>
<p>When you learn of the upcoming marriage of your friend to the princess Dunya, your heart overflows with joy. You compose a long and poetic prayer to Allah in praise of the young couple, the beauty of love, and the immeasurable generosity of the God Who has chosen to grant them such happiness. The Sultan is so impressed by the passion and emotion in your prayers that he requests to use them at the wedding. You agree, and word of your skill with verse and rhyme spreads far and wide.
