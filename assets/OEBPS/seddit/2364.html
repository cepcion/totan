<p class="TaleDestiny">(2364) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You have something of interest to the other, who wishes to purchase it from you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You accept the payment of one gold coin. The other puts it in your hand, but before you can close your fist, the coin is gone! You call the other back to explain the situation. With raised eyebrow, the other warily puts another coin in your hand. You make a fist but when you open it again, you discover the coin is gone! Frustrated, you turn, but the other laughs and says, &ldquo;You have been a good sport. Come, let me pay you for the entertainment you have provided me.&rdquo; And in your hand a purse of gold is placed. [W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You haggle for a higher price, but the other becomes angry. &ldquo;Come now, you are wasting my time. Let us trade or let us part.&rdquo; You declare a fair price but then the other balks. &ldquo;First you thought your item was worth much more and now you have come down so far in value, I cannot believe this item is worth anything.&rdquo; And with that he departs, leaving you in a confused state.
