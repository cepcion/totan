<p class="TaleDestiny">(2477) - LUCK</p>
<p>You have finally found your way again after wandering in the mountains for many days. Somehow, you have attracted the attention of a hunting cat. It is a great creature, with enormous fangs that curve like scimitars. You can hear its hungry growls in the night, but so far it hasn&rsquo;t been brave enough to approach you. But your own hunger has weakened you, and you cannot hope to fight it off alone.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is too late. You stagger down the mountain, but the hungry beast draws near. Your only hope is to find a camp, but the cat leaps before you do, and darkness washes over you. You come to some time later, your wounds bound in thick bandages, and the smiling face of a woodsman gazing down upon you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You pick your way carefully down the mountain, hoping that the column of smoke you see belongs to a woodsman&rsquo;s hovel or camp. You stagger into the clearing barely conscious. You hear the growls of the beast as a burly woodsman approaches you. It seems the terrible beast will go hungry for another day.
