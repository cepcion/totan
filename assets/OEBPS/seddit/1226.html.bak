<p class="TaleDestiny">(1226) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Calamity and peril! You have been captured by a horrible giant. &ldquo;I cook you tomorrow,&rdquo; he grunts. You offer gold, service, entertainment&mdash;he is not interested. Finally you offer to best him in a contest. &ldquo;If you do that,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I shall free you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do your best, and though he defeats you in every contest, he is so amused by your antics that he decides to keep you as a pet. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You declare a contest to see who can be the first to seduce a member of the opposite sex. He sets you in a pit with another of his captives, a most comely young person. You make clear by signs that your &ldquo;target&rdquo; should play at being seduced, and you fool the giant completely. As the females of his kind are even more vicious than the males, he concedes the contest and sets you both free. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / Choice of <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> or Acting and Disguise]</p>
