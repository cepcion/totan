<p class="TaleDestiny">(647) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you lean closer to the water, you see a distorted reflection of the face of a person of the opposite sex. You look behind you, but no one is there.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shrug, turn back, and drink your fill. Suddenly a strange sensation comes over you, and you clutch your hands to your chest. You discover that you are&hellip; different. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recall the ancient legends of the spring which makes a man a woman, and a woman a man. You are terribly thirsty, but decide to wait for a safer opportunity. [D+1]</p>
