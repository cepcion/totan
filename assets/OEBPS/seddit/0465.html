<p class="TaleDestiny">(465) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>When you finished administering your punishment, your victim eagerly entreats you to continue. Wherever you go, he follows, begging for more
&ldquo;justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no idea whether he is mocking you or not, but his yammering is driving you mad! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You have pity on the poor wretch, who is obviously demented rather than truly evil. You convince another to care for him out of charity. Your reputation is enhanced.
[D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
