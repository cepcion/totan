<p class="TaleDestiny">(1717) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Seeing the plight of the evil king&rsquo;s children held prisoner in the palace of crystal, you fly into an unreasoning rage. Throwing caution to the wind, you hurl yourself against the guards at the gate, and soon you are in a battle fit for the storybooks.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The palace guards eventually overcome you. You are hurled into the dungeon to await your ultimate fate. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: After the guards handily defeat you, you are dragged before the cruel monarch. Asked to defend your actions, you weave such a moving tale that even his stony heart is softened. So great is his pity for you, he awards you with valuable presents before releasing you. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
