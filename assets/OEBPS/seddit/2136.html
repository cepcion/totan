<p class="TaleDestiny">(2136) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You discover the ruins of a lost city in the desert. You are too cautious to explore the ruins more closely, but you are convinced that you saw the reflection of gold among the aged buildings. This knowledge will no doubt be valuable to someone.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Few are willing to listen to your story, and none believe you.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: When the sages and scholars in the nearby city doubt your descriptions, you decide to visit with the city&rsquo;s renowned Beggar King. Your ability to recognize which of the beggars are part of the King&rsquo;s shadowy network allows you to track down his location. Intrigued by your story, he sends you back out with ten of his strongest men. So fortified, you enter the city, find several golden plates, and return with them. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)</p>
