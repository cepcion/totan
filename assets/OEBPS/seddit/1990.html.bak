<p>At the last village before you reach the Valley of Dogs, you have a chance to speak with a kindly old innkeeper. He warns you about the dangers of the Valley.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though he is too old to guide you himself, the innkeeper does know of a secret path that should get you across safely. You are happy to give him a small gift in exchange for the information. [D+1 / W-1
(Min: Poor) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: As the innkeeper describes the secret pathway, you realize that it&rsquo;s not only a safe way to cross the Valley of Dogs, but it&rsquo;s actually the way to a legendary lost wonder! You thank him for his kindness and hurry on your way. [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="1400.html#TaleHeader">Sepulchre of Solomon</a>]</p>
