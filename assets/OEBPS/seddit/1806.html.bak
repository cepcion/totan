<p class="TaleDestiny">(1806) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Walking along the shore, you discover a number of men in small boats. You realize that they are pearl divers! You decide you would like to attempt the dangerous feat, but you know that some training might just save your life.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You approach a few of the divers, but they refuse to share their secrets with you. They offer to sell you some of their pearls, but you politely decline their offer. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You find an old man repairing his ropes. He is too old to dive himself and seems delighted to have a healthy young assistant. He shows you the basic techniques, and before long you are pulling great oysters up from the bottom! [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
