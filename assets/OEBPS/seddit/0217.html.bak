<p>Despite your quick action, the other sends his servants to catch you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot escape them. They catch you and throw you in a well, where they torment you for many days. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You cannot escape them; they catch you and throw you in a well. Before long, you are left alone. A scorpion drops on your head. After you kill it, you wonder where it came from. Your search reveals a small crevice leading to a forgotten treasure room! Thanking the Most High for your good fortune, you loot the place and escape through a hidden trap-door. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> Whenever the servants draw near to you, the Brass Trumpet sounds forth its clear, clean tone. This calls the attention of a passing band of soldiers, who drive off your tormentors and free you. [D+2 / S+1]
