<p>The youngest son of the Sultan asks you to help him hunt the most dangerous creature in the kingdom: the spear-nosed rhinoceros. Before you depart, the Sultan warns you that whatever fate befalls his son will befall you as well.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Despite your efforts, you and the prince are unable to locate any rhinos in the area. Disappointed, but safe, you return to the palace.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE  (mandatory):</span> With your superior tracking skills, you easily find one of the mysterious rhinos. Despite your warnings, the prince attacks the beast.</p>

<li class="TaleDieRollResult">3&ndash;4: The prince is not a skilled hunter, and you are barely able to save him from the dangerous animal. The Sultan is furious about the wounds the prince endured and claps you in irons for your negligence. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">5&ndash;9: Despite the prince&rsquo;s bumbling, you manage to drive the creature off before it harms him.
