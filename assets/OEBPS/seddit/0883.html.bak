<p class="TaleDestiny">(883) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>By the will of Allah, a great crowd of small white birds has descended upon you. They do you no harm, but their unceasing cries and foul droppings threaten to drive you mad, nor do they fail to steal away many small belongings, tearing at your clothes and plucking your hair.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You curse them with a thousand vile epithets, and flail at them with your fists and sword, but better it would be try to drain the ocean with a spoon, for you never manage to hurt a one. Their foul dung coats you head to foot. Finally, in one moment, they lift and fly away, their cries sounding as mocking laughter. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You hold out food and make soft noises, and in this way you lure a bird close to you. Quickly you seize it by the neck, and wring the life from it. Its piteous cry serves as an effective communication to the other birds, who depart as quickly as a cutpurse who sees the Sultan&rsquo;s guards. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
