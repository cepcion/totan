<p class="TaleDestiny">(1694) - APPEARANCE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You have, through no fault of your own, attracted the attention of one of the mightiest of the jinn. Desperate to curry favor, you begin to spin an elaborate (and completely false) story of your quest to obtain enough wealth to pay for the dowry of your beloved, fair as moonlight and completely out of your reach.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other laughs at your tale of hardship. &ldquo;If you are so vexed by your unfulfilled desire for the one you describe,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;I shall remove the problem for you!&rdquo; [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: An odd smile flickers across the other&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;I can grant you the dowry,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;but you might find it hard to return to your beloved!&rdquo; So saying, the other allows you a brief entry into the world beyond the world, whence you return with your arms full of gold and your memory filled with strange and unwelcome sights. [S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
