<p>Near the city of King Shehyal, the ruins of a city from Solomon&rsquo;s time are discovered. You join in the investigation and search the ruins. Among your companions are agents of King Shehyal.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your group is plagued by a series of accidents. Finally, the King orders you to leave the site &ldquo;for your own safety.&rdquo; You go away empty-handed, certain that the King will not leave the ruins unmolested.
[D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You seek an audience with the King to assure him that he will receive a most generous share of any discovery you make. Thus, all are happy and the expedition is a success. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
