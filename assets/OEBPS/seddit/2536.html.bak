<p class="TaleDestiny">(2536) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>As you relax under a tall palm on a particularly warm afternoon, the other approaches you in the shimmering heat. He is obviously thirsty and hungry, and you have plenty of figs and water in your pack. You offer him some, and he draws up short. &ldquo;Have I fallen so far that I must accept charity? No! Instead, I ask that you consider this an investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You smile and give the man a large handful of figs and as much water as he can drink. &ldquo;The well-being of all men is the greatest investment,&rdquo; you say, and go on your way. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You are impressed by the man&rsquo;s bearing even in a hard situation and talk further. Before the day is out, you are business partners&mdash;and he is every bit as good as your first impression lead you to believe. [D+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)</p>
