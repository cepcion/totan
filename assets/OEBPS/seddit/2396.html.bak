<p>You round a corner in the road you walk and see before you a cave, blocked by great stones. Sitting on the largest of the stones is one draped in fine clothing that bespeaks great wealth. &ldquo;My brother, a prince among my kind, is trapped in that cave. Only a mortal can open it. I miss him so much&mdash;can you help?&rdquo; The sadness in the other&rsquo;s voice convinces you to assist.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: So you aid in removing the rock from the cave&rsquo;s entrance. No sooner than the deed is done do the prince and his conniving sibling push you into the cave and seal it up! You have learned a valuable lesson in trust. [You do not move next turn but you will draw an encounter card]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, WISDOM</span>: However, as you come closer, you notice words of power carved into the rock: this is not a normal imprisonment and the prisoner must be very powerful indeed. You feign a strained back and start hobbling away. The other hastens your retreat with a bolt of lightning, but cannot pursue you past the rock that is a prison to them both. [D+1 / S+2)</p>
