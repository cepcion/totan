<p class="TaleDestiny">(2272) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>The other has managed to seat himself at the center of a vast web of criminal mischief, and you cannot stand by while he prospers. You swear justice will be done.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, the powerful are called powerful for a reason. You are unable to get past the other&rsquo;s layers of hangers-on and are forced to give up on your hopes. Perhaps a more indirect approach would have worked? [S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You cannot get close to the other within the town, but you know him to be an avid gambler. You make sure he hears of a game you are running, and, with the help of friends of your own, you fleece him like a newborn lamb. So clever was your con that he never suspects the game was rigged. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
