<p class="TaleDestiny">(2485) - MAGIC</p>
<p>On a cold, dry night, you lie under a palm near an old oasis. In the light of your dying fire, you see a woman dressed in the armor of the ancient Greeks. She is surrounded by a circle of illuminated sigils. As you approach in wonder, she tells you a tale: &ldquo;Deep in the mountains to the south dwelled a horrible monster with a hundred tails and a dozen tooth-filled heads. My Amazons and I sought to slay it, but it was controlled by a foul sorcerer. We triumphed over both monster and master, but with his dying breath, the wizard cursed us. Each night when the moon is fullest, I appear in this circle in the site of my former home. I cannot be free until I am bested in battle. Will you challenge me?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Wracked with pity, you draw your sword and raise it above your head to honor of your foe. The fight is fierce, but you cannot match the woman warrior&rsquo;s years of experience. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You shake your head and ask, &ldquo;What if there is another way?&rdquo; Hope lights on her face. In time, you are able to break the magic of the sigils, freeing the valiant woman. As she steps from the circle, time catches up and she crumbles to dust. Only a brilliant sword remains to mark her passage, the last of her line. [D+2 / Thunderbolt Sword]</p>
