<p class="TaleDestiny">(2130) - PIETY</p>
<p>You are staying with a wealthy merchant. After a sumptuous meal, you are escorted to your room. The bed is wondrously soft and full. But the real treasure of the room is a huge standing armoire. The wood is intricately carved and the latch is worked silver. You open the door to see whirling mists beyond. Something compels you forward: trusting your fate to Allah, you step inside.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You find yourself in an enchanted jungle. The monkeys and birds sound their calls, which seem to worm their way into your mind. You stumble back, falling out of the strange world&mdash;but you bring some of its strangeness with you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Allah hears your call and protects you as you wander an enchanted jungle. Strange birds and animals frolic around you. An enormous bear appears and speaks with you at length about the place and its features. After an exceedingly pleasant stay, the bear escorts you back to the mist and into your room. [D+1 / S+2 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
