<p class="TaleDestiny">(2442) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>The Sultan has offered an enormous reward for any who can capture the strange creature that has attacked his flocks unceasingly for the past few weeks. Eager to add his gems to your collection, you set out in search of the horrific beast you have heard so many tales about.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You know that you cannot harm the creature, so you devise a plan to lure it into a trap. Though it is hideous and ugly, you believe that it will be attracted to something beautiful. Unfortunately, the beautiful thing it is attracted to is you! [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Seduction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: While the beast is distracted by the lure of the flock, you creep up behind it. Catching it unawares, you strike it with a cudgel. When you drag the unconscious form before the Sultan, you are amazed to learn that it is his own brother, enchanted by an evil sorceress! [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
