<p class="TaleDestiny">(2450) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You see a merchant transporting an enormous egg in a wagon. You realize that he has found a roc&rsquo;s egg! You decide to follow him from a safe distance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are not much surprised to see the egg&rsquo;s mother swoop down and scatter the caravan, claiming her egg again. At least you can find some valuables among the wreckage left behind. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: When you see the mother roc appear on the horizon, you run to the merchant to warn him. Wisely, he abandons the egg and makes a hasty escape. He rewards you for saving his life. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
