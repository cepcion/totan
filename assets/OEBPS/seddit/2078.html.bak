<p class="TaleDestiny">(2078) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Having watched this so-called captain fleece family after family out of their lives&rsquo; earnings, you decide that someone must put a stop to it. And that &ldquo;someone&rdquo; is you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait until dark before trying to sneak into the captain&rsquo;s stateroom, but you are caught, robbed, and thrown overboard. Still, news of your deeds reaches the captain&rsquo;s victims and they exalt your name loudly in the streets. [D+2 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You wait for the perfect moment to strike, and when you do, the captain reveals himself for the coward he is. You best him with a blade and take back all the money he stole, becoming a folk hero in the process! [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
