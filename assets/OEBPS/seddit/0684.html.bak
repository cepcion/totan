<p>You join the crowd of onlookers who chatter nervously as the house is consumed by flames.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: An old woman harangues the crowd: &ldquo;Shame! Can you only stand about and gape!? Now is the time for the youthful to take action!&rdquo; You are shamed. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You notice two men who laugh and point at the flames. Wisely, you move closer to them to hear their conversation. You discover they have set the fire, for the owner of the house was a business rival. Your evidence is brought to the Sultan&rsquo;s attention, and the culprits are punished. You are rewarded for your role in bringing justice.
