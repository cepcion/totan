<p class="TaleDestiny">(712) - MAGIC</p>
<p>A great cloud of silvery light bobs toward you. You see patterns of movement within it, but cannot make sense of them without drawing nearer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are too prudent to do that, and you go on your way. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: There is a spirit trapped within the cloud of light. You focus your arcane powers and manage to release it from captivity. The grateful
&rsquo;efreet tells you of battling a wizard for possession of a magical item. He was victorious, but suffered the wizard&rsquo;s final curse, and was set drifting in the sphere of light. He is grateful to you for freeing him, and offers you the treasure he wrested from the wizard. [D+2 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
