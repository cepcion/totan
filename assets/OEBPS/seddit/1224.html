<p class="TaleDestiny">(1224) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Far from civilization, your party stumbles across a pavilion built by a giant. You implore the others in the name of the Most High to turn and flee, but you are too late&mdash;the giant returns and finds you. As he comes near, you try to strike a bargain with the giant.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Alas, the giant has no interest in what you might offer&mdash;with a roar, he attacks. When the battle is over, the giant is driven off, but at grievous cost. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You suggest a contest of the fabulous, and the giant
(no more eager than you to die) agrees. His story is good, but your tale of the Thief and the Foolish Donkey-Herder sends him into gales of laughter. He lets you go. [D+1 / S+2 / Beguiling]</p>
