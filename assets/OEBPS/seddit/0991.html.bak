<p class="TaleDestiny">(991) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>In a desolate area you come upon a wretched old man, lying by the side of the road. He is at death&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is little you can do for him. You commend him to Allah&rsquo;s mercy. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You take his hand to ease his passage and tell tales of wonder of the gardens of paradise. His eyes fill with tears of gratitude and with his last words he bequeaths his possessions to you, his only friend in his last hour. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Piety]</p>
