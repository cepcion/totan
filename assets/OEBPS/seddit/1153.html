<p class="TaleDestiny">(1153) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You intended to rob the wicked Vizier Kafour, but his gates are well locked and guarded. Now, a greasy thief offers to sell you a secret way into the vaults.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree, but his information leads through a trapdoor&mdash;into the arms of waiting guards! [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You refuse to pay until after the robbery. He decides to go with you and leads you through a trapdoor into a maze of corridors leading to the treasure vault! &ldquo;We have two minutes before the guard comes,&rdquo; he hisses. You stuff your pockets quickly and make good your escape. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
