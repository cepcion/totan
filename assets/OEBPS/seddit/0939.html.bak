<p class="TaleDestiny">(939) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are concerned as soldiers place the other on a cart and roll it away. You follow them and discern that the soldiers intend to dump the other in an early grave. Outraged, you step in.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You buy the other from the cart handlers and act as the nurse. The other is thankful and spends your days together passing on his skills in wilderness lore. [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You convince the cart handlers that the other is holy man who should be respected in his last days. They believe you and take him in, caring for him until he passes on to Allah. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
