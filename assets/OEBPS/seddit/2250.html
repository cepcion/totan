The speed of his chatter sets your mind whirling, and before you know what you have done, you have committed yourself to aiding him. You sit with the other long into night as he exhausts himself with his long, gloomy tale. Despite the passion of his woe-filled story, and regardless of repeated and patient prompting from you, the other never seems to get around to telling you what exactly what he wants you to do to aid him.</p>
