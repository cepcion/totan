<p class="TaleDestiny">(2268) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You are invited to a marriage of a friend and the eldest child of a potentate of a far land of which you have never heard. You are sure the betrothed is an imposter&mdash;and you swear to undo her disguise and bring her to humiliation.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You spend all of your time trying to figure it out. This makes your friend quite distressed, and you are asked to leave. But you will not stop searching for the truth in this, no matter what. [Fated]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: At the wedding, you are dressed in your finest and turn many eyes&mdash;particularly the one betrothed to your friend! &ldquo;You are quite the important person, aren&rsquo;t you,&rdquo; the other says. &ldquo;Perhaps you can take me away from this wretch?&rdquo; You are aghast and expose the other to your friend immediately. Despite the good you have done, the taint of the scandal sticks to you. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
