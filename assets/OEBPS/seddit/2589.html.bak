<p class="TaleDestiny">(2589) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>A noble has called for all the surrounding villages to come for the wedding of his daughter! For such a grand occasion, he charges you with securing a holy blessing for the couple. You seek out the most devout in the area, a group of mystical Sufi dervishes. Unsure of what will tempt them to comply, you approach to make your request. The leader of the dervishes refuses to entertain your request until you have been properly purified. You attend every service, dancing and whirling until you are out of breath.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You tire quickly and gain no enlightenment. Still, the holy ones agree to attend and bless the union, but only on the condition that you undertake the next pilgrimage with them. You agree. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: As you fight through your exhaustion, your devotion increases. Soon you find yourself very much attracted to this strange devotion. During the wedding, you refuse your seat at the noble&rsquo;s table and instead sit and dance with your newfound friends. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
