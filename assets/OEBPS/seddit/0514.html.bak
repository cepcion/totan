<p class="TaleDestiny">(514) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you walk away, the other follows you, chattering incessantly. None of your acquaintances will approach while he is near.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You turn and beat him soundly to discourage him, and finally drive him away. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize a thread of sense in his ramblings, so you take him to your abode and show him hospitality. You eventually learn that he once stole a powerful magic item from a sorcerer, and the sorcerer&rsquo;s curse has driven him mad. Several weeks in your care restore him to his senses. In thanks, he makes you a gift of the item. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety / Ebony Horse]</p>
