<p class="TaleDestiny">(476) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The other is beset by robbers! With surprising strength, he hurls the first of them to the ground&mdash;then the rest are upon him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Alone, he is no match for so many, and he is overwhelmed. After the ruffians are gone you tend to his wounds. As he recovers, he tells you he is a rich merchant traveling incognito, and the robbers have made off with a handful of valuable gems. [D-1 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You cannot stand by and watch as the other is attacked, and you throw yourself into the fray! The other is a mighty fighter, and with your help the robbers are driven off. The one you save is a rich merchant in disguise, and he rewards you with a gem as large as a horse&rsquo;s eye! [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
