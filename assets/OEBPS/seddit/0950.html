<p class="TaleDestiny">(950) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>With scorn on your face you attack your hapless foe. Unwittingly, in your eagerness, you free him!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other flees from you, a cry on his lips. The other is adept at the ways of the wild and evades your pursuit. You must assuage your rage another day. [D-2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The other flees into the wilds with you hot on his trail. After a day&rsquo;s chase you corner the other in a lonely mountain pass. He is too exhausted to put up a fight and is easily slain. [D-1 / W+1
(Max: Poor)]</p>
