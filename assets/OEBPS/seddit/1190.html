<p class="TaleDestiny">(1190) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You track a wounded elephant, hoping to find the fabled Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. Indeed, the trail leads to a great cliff&mdash;down below you see the carcass of the wounded animal, and the bones and tusks of generations.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are overcome with greed and scramble down. The way down is treacherous, and you slip and fall. Your injuries are painful; only through determination do you manage to drag yourself out. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Even if you could get down safely, you could never bear out anything of value. You&rsquo;re content observing this marvel, and returning to tell of it. [D+1 / S+2 / Storytelling]</p>
