<p class="TaleDestiny">(2577) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You have been cast into prison on a false charge of poaching one of the prince&rsquo;s sheep. While awaiting your chance to prove your innocence, you find that you can speak easily with the prisoner in the next room, and you learn that she is accused of sorcery. You ask her why she does not use her skills to free herself, and she explains that she can only use her magic to help others, and only for a price. You talk with her long through the night.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In the morning, when the jailer comes, you tell him that you are willing to testify all that you have heard from the witch in exchange for your own freedom. He takes you to the magistrate, who records your statement and lets you go free. The witch sends her own greetings after you, though. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: After a few minutes of further conversation, you realize that she is quite sincere in her beliefs, and by subtle means you lead her to reveal many of her secrets. Finally, when you are convinced that she really knows whereof she speaks, you toss her a small pearl from your shoes. &ldquo;Here is your payment.&rdquo; With that, she says a few words and you are standing, free, outside the town.
