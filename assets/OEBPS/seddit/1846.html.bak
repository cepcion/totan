<p class="TaleDestiny">(1846) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You find a crippled huntsman leaning against a tree. He tells you of his encounter with a ferocious rhinoceros. Though he is no longer able to hunt, he is determined to get his revenge on the creature that left him crippled. He has devised a trap for the animal, but he needs someone to lure it in.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to lure the great beast into the trap with noises and gestures, but it seems too cunning to fall for your ruse. Frustrated by your failure, you return to the huntsman, but he has succumbed to his wounds. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You discover that the rhino is too crafty to be lured directly into the trap. You are reminded of tales of the animosity between rhinos and elephants. You hastily construct a mock elephant, and, imitating its noises, you enrage the rhino. As it charges you, you leap across the trap pit, into which the rhino tumbles with a sickening sound. The dying huntsman thanks you with a map to his greatest discovery. [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0180.html#TaleHeader">Valley of Diamonds</a>]</p>
