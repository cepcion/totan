<p class="TaleDestiny">(1986) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You are approaching the fabled &ldquo;Valley of Dogs,&rdquo; a place known to be the home of wild beasts and wilder men. You see a seasoned fellow sitting near a pillar of rock near the entrance to the valley. He warns, &ldquo;You do not want to enter without a guide!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You don&rsquo;t think the fellow looks particularly trustworthy. Better to take your chances. It turns out that you made a good choice, as you encounter the same fellow with a band of robbers halfway through the valley. Not that your wisdom will save you from paying them&hellip; [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Respectable)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: While you don&rsquo;t trust this &ldquo;guide,&rdquo; you decide you might as well pay him now. At least if bandits do attack, they won&rsquo;t get as much from you. But you are surprised when the guide delivers you to the far side of the valley in safety. [D+1]</p>
