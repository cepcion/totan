<p class="TaleDestiny">(2054) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>While traveling through an arid wasteland, you encounter a band of desperate brigands. They seem low on supplies and begin eyeing your saddlebags intently.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You ask the brigands if they wish to buy some of your water, but brigands will be brigands, and they respond by just robbing you and leaving you for dead. [S+2 / Reduce your Wealth to Beggar, but gain D+1 for each level lost in this way]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Sensing what&rsquo;s to come, you ask the brigands if they will consider an alternative to robbing you and leaving you for dead. You offer to show them the way out of the wasteland, by way of an oasis where they may refill their water skins, in exchange for your life
(and a modest sum, of course). [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]
