<p class="TaleDestiny">(2024) - WISDOM</p>
<p>A distinguished old merchant has heard of your deeds and prowess. He invites you to his home for a meal. When you arrive you find a gathering of important members of the local community. Conversation is lively and cultured, and you participate as best you can. Later in the evening, you suggest, &ldquo;Let us all bow down to Allah, who has given us such bounty and good company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your attempts at wit during the course of the evening have been halting and uninformed. The manner of your suggestion conveys a sense of contempt for those around you. The group follows your lead (how can they refuse tribute to the Almighty One?) but they resent your implication. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The crowd is well pleased by your wisdom during the evening&rsquo;s lengthy conversations. Taken by the manner and appropriateness of your suggestion, they readily accept it as a fitting culmination to an enchanting gathering. [D+2 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
