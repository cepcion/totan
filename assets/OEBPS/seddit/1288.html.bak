<p class="TaleDestiny">(1288) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>A wizard consents to aid you for a share of the profits. His magic opens the caves, but from inside a huge man with a scimitar rushes forward!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With a single stroke, the guardian slays the wizard and leaps back within the cave, which seals behind him. You cannot enter! You bury the wizard but cannot escape your own guilty heart for leading him to this sad fate. [D+1 / S+2 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You leap forward and cut the man down. Within is enough wealth and magic to make you a king! The wizard agrees to aid you in exchange for a position as a Vizier, and soon you rule over a kingdom! [D+4 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span> / Treasure]</p>
