<p>The other&rsquo;s voice booms in your ear. &ldquo;What is your life worth?&rdquo; Caught off-guard, you know not what to say: you never expected to be bargaining for your life this day.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You start babbling, then pleading for your life to be spared.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If your Wealth is Respectable or greater</span>: You offer gold, jewels, slaves&mdash;but nothing interests the other. Soon, he shakes his head. &ldquo;You are completely beneath my consideration.&rdquo; So saying this, the other vanishes in a dark cloud of smoke. [D-1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If your Wealth is Poor or less</span>: Saddened, you say you have nothing to offer. The other shakes his head. &ldquo;You have more to offer than material goods. Allah created men for a higher purpose in life than to just wallow in material things. Your potential is greater than all the wealth in a Sultan&rsquo;s treasury.&rdquo; The other departs in a cloud of smoke, leaving you to ponder his words carefully. [D+1 / Wisdom]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: &ldquo;My life,&rdquo; you begin, &ldquo;has the same value as all of Allah&rsquo;s creatures.&rdquo; The other, surprised at the strength of your faith, bows low and departs. [D+2]</p>
