<p class="TaleDestiny">(1685) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>The other walks ahead of you through town and you follow, waiting to ensnare him in your schemes. The night sky is obscured by clouds, and you suddenly realize you are lost amongst the dunes. Words and fragments of sentences come to you as if shouted from across a great distance&mdash;the true names of angels and the false names, pieces of alchemical formulas and mathematical proofs. You race after them, certain they will bring you to the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are deeply frustrated by the little bits you can hear. If only you could find their source&mdash;but dawn comes and find you no closer to wisdom, or to lands you know. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You know that sounds carry strangely in the desert. Closing your eyes, you let your ears be your sole guide. Eventually, you come to the wizard, deep in conversation with a looming jinni. You drink deeply of their knowledge without their ever knowing of it. [S+1 / Magic]</p>
