<p>You speak with another of shared experiences: struggling to survive, learning hard lessons, and seeing many strange and wondrous things. The other expresses a loneliness birthed by the road that you find matched in your own soul. You ask what compels the other to keep traveling. It seems that the local prince was hoarding so much gold that the village was starving. The other snuck in to the prince&rsquo;s palace, stole some of the gold, distributed much of it to the neighbors, and fled into the hills. Returning after many years, the other had found that home was no longer familiar. Recognizing the story as one involving your own cousin, who had been executed for accepting some of the stolen gold, you are incensed. You draw your weapon to exact retribution.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other sighs, saddened by your response. The fight is long, but ultimately inconclusive. The traveler departs, never to see home again. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other is an accomplished swordfighter, and the battle is a long one. As the fight continues, you feel the full weight of the other&rsquo;s melancholy, and you cannot help but marvel at the traveler&rsquo;s grace and manners. When you bring the defeated other before the prince, you plead for leniency, explaining of the other&rsquo;s regrets, experiences, and nobility. The prince is touched by your deeds and merciful in judgment. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
