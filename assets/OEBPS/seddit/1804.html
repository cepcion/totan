<p class="TaleDestiny">(1804) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>A dear friend from your childhood has offered to show you the fine art of pearl diving. You stand safely on the shore as he disappears beneath the waves. You watch for a very long time, but there is no sign of your friend. You grow fearful for your bosom friend, and begin to pray to Allah that he will be safe.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Suddenly, the water bubbles and your friend finally breaks through to the surface, barely conscious. Sadly, in his distress, he lost hold of the pearls he had collected. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Your friend needs help! Calling upon your experience as a sailor, you dive into the water, swimming as fast as you can. You find your friend floating limp in the water, and you hoist him to safety. Your sigh of relief turns into a shout of joy as he shares with you his collection of fresh pearls! [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
