<p class="TaleDestiny">(1688) - COURTLY GRACES, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You come across a lost camel, which seems to have wandered far from its owner: it is very well groomed and finely equipped; you realize its owner must be quite wealthy. You mount it and begin to ride. Before even a minute has passed, a jinni appears before you. &ldquo;Foolish mortal! Why have you stolen my camel?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stammer an apology. You try say that you were planning on returning the camel to its owner, but you trip over your own words so badly that the jinni will hear none of it. He gestures, and suddenly you are far away. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Have another player move you four spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: Without pausing even a heartbeat, you dismount and kneel before the towering form. &ldquo;Your most humble servant am I. I found your camel wandering, lost and wild in the world. I rode it to bring it back to you before it could fall into harm.&rdquo; The other ponders your words and then laughs. &ldquo;I cannot tell if you are saying truth or lies, but your bravery does you great honor. Take the camel with my blessing.&rdquo; [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Stealth and Stealing]
