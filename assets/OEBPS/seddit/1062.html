<p class="TaleDestiny">(1062) - SEAMANSHIP  (M), COURTLY GRACES, SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The winds howl, the seas are high, and the captain locks himself below decks. The ship drifts without a master. What causes him to act this way? You batter at the hatch to get him to come back to his duty, but fear that you do not have time to break through before disaster strikes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, SEAMANSHIP  (mandatory):</span> You try to save the ship but are a poor substitute for the captain. The wind drives you into uncharted shores. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Move to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You question the captain through the door and discover he fears that the passengers plot against him. You soothe him with flattery and coax him to face the crisis. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
