<p class="TaleDestiny">(1225) - LUCK, ACCURSED  (M)</p>
<p>In a distant place, a most grotesque scenario develops: you, your beloved, and a companion have been captured by a hideous giant. &ldquo;I will eat one of you tomorrow,&rdquo; he grunts. &ldquo;You decide which.&rdquo; You pray to Allah for deliverance; your beloved is so impressed by your faith that she volunteers to sacrifice herself, but you reason with her that fate should decide.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Leaving nothing to chance, during the night your companion knocks you out and ties you up. The next morning, he gives your beloved to the giant! Even the giant is disgusted by your companion&rsquo;s perfidy; he lets you and your love go and eats the coward. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You draw lots to determine who shall be sacrificed. Your companion loses. You and your beloved are set free. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED  (mandatory):</span> You three prisoners discuss further who should be sacrificed, but end up telling one another your lives&rsquo; stories. When you awaken in the morning, you discover that the love of your life has taken up with your companion, and they have rendered you helpless while you slept. They give you to the giant, and you die with the satisfaction of watching your once-beloved and your erstwhile companion eyeing each other warily: you will be the giant&rsquo;s dinner today, but one of them will be lunch tomorrow, and neither will sleep tonight.
