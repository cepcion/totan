<p class="TaleDestiny">(2490) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Your caravan is stopped for the night in a particularly desolate place. You awake to the sounds of someone rooting through your possessions. Grabbing your blade, you surprise a thin and dirty wretch. You quickly subdue him and tie him to your cart. The desperate one cries, &ldquo;Please spare me! I have been wandering the desert for days in search of food.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You thunder, &ldquo;I am not interested in your tales. Nothing excuses theft!&rdquo; You drive the hungry one off. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Although ill-inclined to grant mercy, your heart softens a bit. You refuse to part with any food, but you do explain how to extract water from certain desert plants and further, which other plants are nourishing despite their foul taste. The other grovels in gratitude, and in thanks tells you a tale of some ruins a short distance away. Come the daylight, you go there and find an ancient treasure. [D+2 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
