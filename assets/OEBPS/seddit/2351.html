<p class="TaleDestiny">(2351) - COURTLY GRACES, APPEARANCE (if the opposite sex)</p>
<p>Although you are showered with gifts and attention, you don&rsquo;t want to be a part of the other&rsquo;s world.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your graceless refusal of his attentions insults the other greatly. The other summons guards to teach you a lesson. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: In words that would satisfy even a Sultan, you convey to the other your desire to be left alone. So charmed, the other agrees&mdash;if you would but accept a single gift from him. [S+1 / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE (if the opposite sex)</span>: No matter how hard you try to convince the other you wish no part of him, he clings to you, devoting himself to you. At some point you are able to escape from his presence, but you know you will see him again. [<span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
