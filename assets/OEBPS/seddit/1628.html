<p class="TaleDestiny">(1628) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>The other lies in a precarious situation, dangling by one hand over the edge of a deep chasm. His only chance of survival is to be pulled up by you. You offer to help if the other will aid you in your journeys. The other refuses. You use your dagger to loose his remaining hand from the rock. He plunges downward, cursing you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You continue on your way, wasting no more time on thoughts of doomed fools. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You find your way down the path and find the corpse of the person you surrendered to Allah. You remove his belongings before continuing on your journey. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Lose Piety]</p>
