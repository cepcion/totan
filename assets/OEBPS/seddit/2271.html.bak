<p>&ldquo;It matters little how you try to punish me!&rdquo; the other cries. &ldquo;I have been through far worse than your torments in my time!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You listen to his tale of woe and are dumbstruck by the magnitude of suffering revealed. You give the wretch some coin to ease his pain and he leaves your presence a changed being. [D+1 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: The other&rsquo;s tale is vast and wondrous&mdash;but it does not add up, even for the ravings of a madman. The more you listen, the more you realize that he is retelling stories of old, casting himself as the protagonists (changing just enough that any but the learned would not notice). You trip him up during his tale, revealing him as a mountebank of notorious reputation. You turn him in to the Vizier and are rewarded.
