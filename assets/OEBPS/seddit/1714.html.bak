<p class="TaleDestiny">(1714) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Gazing upon the indescribable beauty of the glass palace, you are struck with wonder and awe that such a structure could be built. You immediately fall to your knees in prayer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The light of the sun shines through the walls of the crystal palace, dazzling you with a display of the glory of the Most High. Your soul is moved by the beauty, and you swear you will never forget the sight Allah has granted you. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The Palace Guards find you kneeling on the ground, in the sunlight that shines through the palace. They are struck by your image of devotion to Allah, and immediately join you in prayer. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
