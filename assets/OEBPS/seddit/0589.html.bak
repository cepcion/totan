<p>The other goes with you meekly. &ldquo;I may as well be your captive as suffer the hundreds of other fates I have been subjected to.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other&rsquo;s gloomy personality depresses you. You get rid of him quickly, but find that his ill fortune lingers with you a while. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You have suffered so much and are sympathetic to the other&rsquo;s plight. You relate many tales of others less fortunate, and in your exchanged tales of misery you discover a common interest. The other becomes your lifelong and devoted friend. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
