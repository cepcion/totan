<p class="TaleDestiny">(2569) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Your mount falls ill and can no longer carry you. At the next village, an old man with wooden teeth offers to transport you on his wagon for a modest fee, which you accept. During your travels, the man tells you a sad tale. He claims to have once been a wealthy trader beset by bandits who stole all but his meager wagon and broken-down horse. Indeed, the transport proves less reliable than you hoped. At various points along the way, the wagon breaks or the horse stalls. Each time, he pitifully requests additional sums to buy food or make repairs.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You warm to the old codger and accede to each request in turn. Feeling good for your act of charity, you do not notice the fine clothing hidden under his cloak, or the bulging sacks in the bed of the wagon. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: &ldquo;Life is pitiless, old man,&rdquo; you explain. &ldquo;I myself have recently lost a fine mount. I will pay what we agreed upon, and no more.&rdquo; The codger continues to whine, but you notice that, after each &ldquo;breakdown,&rdquo; the horse starts up or the wagon continues on even through you have passed him no more money. At the next town, you purchase a camel and gladly rid yourself of this cheat. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
