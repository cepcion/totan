<p class="TaleDestiny">(2538) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>While you shop in the bazaar, a dark and mysterious vendor offers you a magical flute for a princely sum. You reach for your purse, but the other comes over and smacks your hand harshly. &ldquo;Do not buy such junk! That scrap is no more magical than the corns on my toe!&rdquo; The merchant shakes his head. &ldquo;Pay that one no mind&mdash;madness claimed him long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is something in the other&rsquo;s words that makes you believe it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The vendor curses at you and gathers up his blanket of goods in one fell swoop. The other laughs and says, &ldquo;Good choice, my lad. If you want something magical, this will serve well.&rdquo; [S+1 / Copper Drum]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You look more closely at the instrument and find it is indeed a cleverly made forgery. The vendor bows deeply. &ldquo;I can see you are a learned man, I should not have tried to pass off a copy.&rdquo; He produces a shiny bauble from a hidden pouch. &ldquo;Perhaps something genuine might interest you?&rdquo; You glance at the other, who nods approvingly. You haggle for a moment, and walk away with your newfound treasure. [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation / Treasure)</p>
