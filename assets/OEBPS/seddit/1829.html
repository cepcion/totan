<p class="TaleDestiny">(1829) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You realize you made a mistake as soon as the water of the mysterious spring touches your lips. Now you have been transformed into the opposite gender! What price would you not pay to be rid of such a terrible curse?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In a nearby village, a twisted old crone claims to have the solution to your problem. But the price she demands is painfully steep: she demands a Treasure or bags of gold.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you pay her price?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are at a Wealth level of Respectable or less or will not pay</span>: She sends you on your way, still changed. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you have a Wealth level of Rich or greater and you wish to pay</span>: Give her one of your Treasures (return it to the deck). If you have no Treasures, then you give her gold. After handing over payment, she feeds you bitter herbs and speaks curious words you would not dare try to repeat. You are furious when you discover that she has merely swapped one curse for another! [S+1 / Choice of Lose Treasure or W-3 (Min: Penniless) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You encounter a traveling peddler who offers to sell you a magical talisman that will cure you of your curse. You eagerly pay the charlatan. He is long gone before you discover that the totem has no effect on your altered gender, but it may still be valuable in its own right. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span> / Protective Talisman]</p>
