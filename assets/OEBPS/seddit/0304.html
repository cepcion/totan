<p class="TaleDestiny">(304) - PIETY</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a dreadful secret,&rdquo; the other confesses. &ldquo;I am in love with another, but I am not of the Faithful, and her father opposes the marriage. Can you help me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You recoil at such a thought, and consider giving the infidel a good thrashing! You make haste to be elsewhere. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Your carefully considered and pious words soften the heart of the other, turning him towards the True Faith. Once he has accepted the word of Allah, his new father-in-law has no objection to the match. All concerned are most grateful to you. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
