<p class="TaleDestiny">(2008) - WEAPON USE  (M), APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>A ravenous gooleh, frothing at the mouth, springs from the shadows and moves toward you. Her green-tinged, misshapen arms reach for your throat, and you can smell her rancid breath. You kneel down, casting your sword aside, and offer yourself to her hunger. &ldquo;If Allah sees fit to take me into His kingdom now so that you may sustain yourself, so be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> You cannot bring yourself to stand by and be eaten. You dive for your discarded sword and fight for your life! Your sudden resistance surprises the beast, and she lopes away to find easier prey. [D+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: The fiend&rsquo;s desire is tempered by your willingness to abide by Allah&rsquo;s will. But her hunger cannot be contained. She mercifully knocks you out so you won&rsquo;t feel the pain, and only gnaws on you for a short while before departing. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety / Lose Appearance / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
