<p>The other tells you of his problem: an enchantment laid upon him by a wicked sorcerer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You would cheerfully aid him if you could, but you know little of magic. Upon consideration, you decide that the best course when dealing with magic is to leave it well alone. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING  (mandatory):</span> You offer to lift the enchantment for a small fee, knowing full well that it is impossible for you to do so. The other has met your type before, and thrashes you soundly. You flee, and he gives chase. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
