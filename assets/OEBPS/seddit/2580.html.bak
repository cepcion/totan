<p class="TaleDestiny">(2580) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You hear rumors of one in a nearby town who has learned to speak the language of the birds. You visit his home and find it filled with hundreds of birds, the air rank and the calls a near-deafening din. The other speaks in a mad screech that is barely recognizable as human speech. He wants you to go out and find a long-lost treasure of which, he says, the birds have often spoken. He offers to split with you equally anything you recover.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree. The other gives you a falcon to serve you as a guide and watcher. You and your new companion set off into the desert with vague directions and a growing sense of unease. After many weeks, the falcon leaves you and does not return. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You recognize, even through the screeching, that the other is a former courtier. You treat the other&rsquo;s requests with the proper etiquette. The other takes a liking to you and agrees to accompany you on the trip. At various crucial legs of the journey, he calls birds from sky, bearing maps, provisions, or a needed tool. With such help, you are ultimately successful. [D+1 / S+2 / Treasure]</p>
