<p class="TaleDestiny">(1239) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>High in the mountain crags you find a cave, from which comes a most foul stench. Peeking inside, you see a huge serpent sleeping in great coils, and behind it a sleeping maiden. Quietly you approach and prepare to behead the serpent.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you come near, the serpent awakes and bares its fangs, each as long as your sword. Outmatched, you flee. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: With the speed of lightning, you strike. The serpent&rsquo;s head flies from its body, and the maiden runs sobbing to you.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are male and not Married</span>: You dry her tears with the edge of your garment, and speak to her in soft words to still her fear. But even when her tears are quieted she does not release you, and you stand long in the cave in each other&rsquo;s arms. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: You give her your arm and lead her from the cave and return her to her family in a nearby village. They shower you with praise, and spread far and wide the story of your triumph. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
</ul>
