<p class="TaleDestiny">(976) - WISDOM</p>
<p>As you talk, you notice the ancient one has many scars. You wonder deeply about their origin.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You politely inquire as to their cause, and the old man walks quickly away, insulted by your crude manners. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You surreptitiously study them.&rsquo;lhey are whip scars: the sign of slave who has bought his freedom. Mindful of his dignity, you ignore them as you converse. [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
