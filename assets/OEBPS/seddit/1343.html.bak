<p class="TaleDestiny">(1343) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The moans come from a crippled prince. He tells you how his wife fell in love with a wicked slave. When he punished them, she turned his legs to stone and his people to fish. When the slave comes to feed the prince, you slay him and don his clothes. The woman returns.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: She recognizes the sham and blasts you with a spell. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You pretend to be the slave, and request of her that she free the prince and his people so his moans and curses won&rsquo;t trouble you. After she has done so, you leap forward and slay her, and the people shower you with praise. [D+3 / S+3 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
