<p class="TaleDestiny">(1997) - QUICK THINKING, LUCK</p>
<p>Low on supplies, you approach a merchant, offering to barter some of your possessions. A pair of passing guardsmen notice your legitimate discussions but accuse you of attempting to defraud the merchant and immediately impose a hefty fine. You notice a familiarity between the officers and the merchant. You are not the first to fall into this trap.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You accept the soldiers&rsquo; pronouncement, pay the fine, and humbly ask the merchant&rsquo;s forgiveness. Clearly pleased by your capitulation, he embraces you and declares you forgiven. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1
(Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, LUCK</span>: Despite your anger, you praise the guardsmen&rsquo;s perceptiveness and offer some council. Your politeness and respectfulness allows you engage the three cohorts in an extended discussion on the finer points of the law of fraud. During that time, two other soldiers happen by and you ask their opinion on the subject. Fortunately, these newcomers were not part of the deception and quickly declare you innocent.
