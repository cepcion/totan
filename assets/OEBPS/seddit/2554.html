<p class="TaleDestiny">(2554) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Sitting in a local inn, you overhear the most amazing tale! A man has captured a beast marked by Allah. It is rumored that the beast was once human, a woman who found the lost treasure of the Sultans, and was transformed into animal form as punishment. The beast is imprisoned at a local sheik&rsquo;s manor, as scholars attempt to lift the curse and discover the location of the treasure. Without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, you travel to the sheik&rsquo;s house. You scale the wall and steal into the courtyard. You find the beast trapped in a magical cage with a golden lock. Hushing the whining beast, you pick the lock and open the cage door. Suddenly the lock itself begins to scream!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You toss your rope over the animal&rsquo;s neck and drag it away as the guards approach. In the struggle it bites you. Around the bite, your skin begins to grow a thick pelt&hellip; [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You quickly realize that even if you do manage to drag this huge beast off in time, you will have no way of removing the curse. This lock, however, might just fetch a pretty penny. Muffling it in your cloak, you depart. As soon as it quiets, you sell it. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
