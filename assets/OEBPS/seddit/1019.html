<p class="TaleDestiny">(1019) - QUICK THINKING, ACTING AND DISGUISE, BRASS TRUMPET  (M)</p>
<p>An impressive entourage comes down the street toward you. It is the Vizier, a man known to execute those who do not bow low when he passes. You decide to leave immediately.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Vizier sees you leaving. Furious, he orders guards to hunt you relentlessly. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (SOLDIER)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Guards chase you. You duck behind a corner and fold your turban to look like theirs. When the guards run by, you follow, pretending to be one of them until you can make good your escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> The Brass Trumpet warned you of the approach of the vain Vizier long before he could see you, and you make good your escape. [D+2]</p>
