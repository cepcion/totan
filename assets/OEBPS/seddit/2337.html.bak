<p>The captain asks you to join him in his cabin. You follow him inside, whereupon immediately he admits he fears a mutiny is brewing. He wants to know if he can count on your loyalty. While he talks, your eyes scan the cabin and its treasures from past raids.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, you are swept up in the mutiny when it happens and the new captain does not give you an opportunity to visit his cabin. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: While the mutiny takes place, you are able to sneak into the cabin, take some choice items, then return to the deck before anyone notices you are missing. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: While the mutiny takes place, you are able to sneak into the cabin and take the one item that really caught your attention earlier. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
