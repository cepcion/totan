<p class="TaleDestiny">(2482) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You are sitting on a cushion, enjoying your evening meal, when you are approached by a young couple, who join you. When his mate is distracted elsewhere, one of them coos softly in your ear, whispering erotic words. You are deeply offended, pushing the salacious one to the floor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You huff self-righteously, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with you.&rdquo; The couple skulks off. It is only later that you notice your purse is missing. [S+1 / W-1
(Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Shocked and dismayed at your lack of decorum, you offer many apologies and much recompense. You suggest a good meal and pleasant conversation. The other eyes you cautiously for a moment, then smiles and accepts. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
