<p class="TaleDestiny">(427) - COURTLY GRACES, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You engage the other in battle, but immediately you realize that never before have you fought one of such consummate skill.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Easily, he defeats you. The other orders you thrown in his dungeon and fed on bread and water. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You surrender immediately and plead for mercy with excessive flattery of the other&rsquo;s prowess. The other&rsquo;s vanity is swollen and you are permitted to leave. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
