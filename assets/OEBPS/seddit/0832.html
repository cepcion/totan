<p class="TaleDestiny">(832) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Never before have you encountered so bitter and critical a soul. Never happy, always complaining, the other soon drives you to distraction.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You regret your stupid decision to hire this wretch and, for your own sanity, dismiss him. When you do, he bitterly rails against and vilifies you with such anger that others believe that you have sorely wronged him. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The other is a skilled worker, so you tolerate his annoying personality, for you have undergone much worse than a complaining companion. As you praise his work, his disposition improves, and in the fullness of time you benefit greatly from his diligence. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Choice of Bargaining and Evaluation or Scholarship]</p>
