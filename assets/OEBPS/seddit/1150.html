<p class="TaleDestiny">(1150) - STEALTH AND STEALING, ENVIOUS  (M)</p>
<p>A muffled cry attracts your attention to a bare patch of ground where you find a beautiful diamond! Fearing some devilment, you examine it carefully.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is no sign of danger; you touch it, a trapdoor opens beneath you, and you fall in a well with several others. After a cold and miserable day, a mad prophet lets you all out, saying, &ldquo;Beware avarice!&rdquo;
[D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: A fine wire leads from the diamond to a cleverly concealed latch&mdash;there is a trapdoor beneath your feet! You take the diamond and free several less cautious than you from the trap. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> You see no hint of danger, and the size of the diamond dispels all caution. When your grasping fingers reach the gem, a trapdoor opens below you and you fall into a pit. Your greed is such that you maintain your grip on the gem, and the other victims caught in the pit tear you limb from limb in their desire to attain it. [Death]</p>
