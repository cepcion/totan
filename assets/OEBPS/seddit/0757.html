<p class="TaleDestiny">(757) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You stumble and collapse, half-conscious. The sand covers you until only your head is left above the surface. Finally the storm slackens, and worse becomes worst, for a band of desert nomads happen by and notice your predicament!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They cheerfully taunt you&hellip; and leave you to free yourself as best you can. Finally you manage to crawl out of the sand, but thirst and exposure have left you weakened. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You convince them that you are the living head of an executed man. Awed by such a malignant will, they do your bidding, bringing you water to slake your thirst. You maintain the ruse for hours, until finally you order them to leave you. When they are finally gone, you free yourself from the sand. [D+1 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship / Acting and Disguise]</p>
