<p class="TaleDestiny">(923) - QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>While conversing with a local herdsman, you hear his tale of woe: a great mastiff has been attacking the herds and slaying many sheep. You offer to organize the local folk and bring the dog to heel.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your plan, though well intended, is inadequate. The great beast injures several of the folk, and escapes easily. You are shamed for your failure. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You ask the locals for a sheep to serve as bait. Then, with the aid of a clever old trapper, you contrive a net-trap. The dog is captured without injury&mdash;which is fortunate, for the dog is the prize possession of an emir, who rewards you for returning his pet. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You wait until nightfall, when the dog comes; then you command it by the power of the Golden Bridle. The dog is captured without injury&mdash;which is fortunate, for the dog is the prize possession of an emir, who rewards you for returning his pet. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
