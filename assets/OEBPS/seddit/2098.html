<p class="TaleDestiny">(2098) - WISDOM</p>
<p>After years of searching for the Six-Pointed Star of Wonder, you finally track its location to the mad captain who, according to legend, first recovered it from its dusty resting place.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Under the pretext of looking for a good sailor to help navigate an especially treacherous stretch of seaway, you engage the mad captain in conversation. You continue to ply him with wine until, finally, he passes out under the table, leaving you free to sneak into his quarters and pilfer the artifact for yourself. Unfortunately, the rumors about the Star&rsquo;s being cursed are true, thus making you now the curse&rsquo;s bearer! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> ]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Under the pretext of looking for a good sailor to help navigate an especially treacherous stretch of seaway, you engage the mad captain in conversation. Over the course of the evening, it becomes clear to you that the captain was just as sane before acquiring the relic as he is insane now. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cursed,&rdquo; he mewls. &ldquo;No good can come of it.&rdquo; And although you&rsquo;ve spent years in search of it and are finally at the threshold of acquiring it, something in the mad captain&rsquo;s words rings true. With a clear conscience you feel you can finally abandon your need to acquire the Star. [D+2 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
