<p class="TaleDestiny">(1964) - FATED  (M),  LUCK</p>
<p>When one kingdom sends out a warfleet, others usually follow suit. You realize that the safest place to be is in one of these enormous fleets. You decide to follow along as far as you can.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You count yourself lucky to have chosen such a large fleet to join. Two other warfleets collide with yours, and though you are forced to defend yourself, you have no doubt that you would have fared much worse had you been on your own. [S+1]</p>
