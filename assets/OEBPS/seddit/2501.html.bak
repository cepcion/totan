<p class="TaleDestiny">(2501) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, BEGUILING, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Walking along a lonely road, you hear a strange sound. You discover a soldier making screeching noises. He claims to be able to speak with birds. A good friend&mdash;a hawk&mdash;is lost and will not answer to his call. Astounded by the other&rsquo;s claim, you vow to help. You search high and low and discover a small camp. Two bandits are laughing, and beside them in a wooden cage sits a very agitated bird! You walk up boldly and sit down next to them. They draw their weapons, but you assure them you mean them no harm.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Despite your pleasant air and easy manner, the two criminals remain suspicious. They never let down their guard, and soon take their leave. The soldier will have to find another friend to speak with. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, BEGUILING, STORYTELLING</span>: You calmly tell them that you are out looking for a bird, one cursed by a powerful witch. It seems anyone who possesses this bird will be turned into one himself at the first light of dawn. The two men look at you nervously, and then at the bird next to them. One of them leans over and quickly releases the bird, which immediately flies to freedom. You tell the men they were very wise and stay the evening, drinking and laughing with them. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
