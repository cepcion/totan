<p class="TaleDestiny">(1643) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>The other cries out for your assistance. He has been placed under a strange curse for disturbing the wildlife here. He is slowly being turned into a tree, starting with his legs&rsquo; becoming rooted to the ground. You beseech whatever spirit has done this to the other to free him, for he did not know he had committed any offense.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your fervent cries for help do no good against the curse. As the other&rsquo;s body finishes the transformation, he makes you swear that you will tell his family what has happened. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: After you grovel for a long time, the other&rsquo;s situation becomes more pressing. The transformation nears completion, changing all he is into plant-life from the neck down. Seeing no choice, you dig up the roots and heft him up. You carry him as far from the cursed grove as possible. Reaching the edge of the forest, the change begins to undo itself. However, you feel a tightening in your arms: the curse has transformed itself to you! You continue to flee the area and halt your transformation as well. Though the curse does not progress, parts of your body are as gnarled as roots. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
