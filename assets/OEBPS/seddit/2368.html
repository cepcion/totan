<p class="TaleDestiny">(2368) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Your weapon moves like the lightning from a spring storm, and the other is taken by surprise.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your blade encounters nothing but empty air; the other has disappeared like morning mist, leaving only the echoes of his laughter.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: At the last moment, you think better of attacking a wielder of magic with weapons of mere steel. So you decide to put on a show of skill by fighting an invisible foe to the delight of the other. In praise of your skill, you are given a small gift. [Weapon Use / Magic Bead]</p>
