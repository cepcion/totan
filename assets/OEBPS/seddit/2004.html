<p class="TaleDestiny">(2004) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>An unpleasant fellow with two soldiers at his side approaches you as you travel down a public road. He claims to be a tax collector, notes your possessions, and imposes a surcharge for your use of the passage. You notice that the soldier&rsquo;s gear is mismatched and tarnished. Suspecting a scam, you loudly proclaim your faith in Allah and seek his blessing in easing your way through life. You attract a crowd with your pious entreaties.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You present a pathetic and embarrassing sight. The crowd is amused. The ringleader raps you sharply on the head with his cudgel and snatches some of your belongings. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: Your endearing visage and pious manner passionately convey your plight, and the crowd takes up your call. In the hubbub, the strong men skulk out of sight. [D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
