<p>Clearly, the other is part of some scheme against you, otherwise he would not be so friendly. If you slay him, he&rsquo;ll never scheme against you again!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As soon as you set upon the other, his friends come to his aid. You take a few severe blows before you are able to make good your escape, but you have learned much about fighting many at once. [D+1 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You assail the other with your blade, but he expected such and was ready with his defense. As you duel, the rest of his gang surrounds you. Your only hope of escape is to clamber up a nearby pole. Fortunately, your experience on sailing ships has honed such acrobatic skills, and you rapidly ascend to the safety of the rooftops.
