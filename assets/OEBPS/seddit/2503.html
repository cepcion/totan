<p class="TaleDestiny">(2503) - APPEARANCE  (M), WISDOM</p>
<p>When impressing members of the fairer sex, a sharp wit and easy speech are enormous assets, while a strong back is not always helpful. You watch as the biggest man you have ever seen stumbles and stammers over a young maiden collecting water from a well. He stutters many times, and once almost knocks over her water jug! You approach the strong one, saying, &ldquo;My friend, you seem to be distressed. Do you wish to court this lovely maiden?&rdquo; He nods dumbly. You take him to the market and show him many gifts that will win the young maiden&rsquo;s heart. He does not understand. Finally, you decide to show him what to do. You whisper in his ear as he writes bad poetry, sings like a camel in heat, and delivers gifts so heavy that two normal grown men could not lift them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> You spend the next few days with the clumsy oaf, and others begin to notice you. Unfortunately, the fair maiden is one of them. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> (if you are male) or <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (if you are female)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The girl comes to appreciate the large one, but cannot find it in her heart to love him. You, on the other hand, learn quite a bit about courting. [D+1 / S+1 / Seduction]</p>
