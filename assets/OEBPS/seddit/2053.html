<p class="TaleDestiny">(2053) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>While sailing on board a fishing vessel, a gang of brigands emerges from the cargo hold. The brigands quickly take over the ship, but at a high cost to the crew. With the ship secured, the brigands bring you before their leader, who grants you a single question.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You ask if he will spare your life, and he responds by tossing you overboard. It takes you hours to reach land, but at least you&rsquo;re alive.
[D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You ask if he has need of another crew member, knowing full well that he does. He agrees to spare your life, and even pay you a small sum, in exchange for helping him man his stolen ship.
[D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
