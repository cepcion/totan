<p class="TaleDestiny">(1605) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>In the bustling bazaar you weave through people and tents until you believe you have lost your pursuer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are proven wrong. Very wrong. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Even though you switched clothes while running through the bazaar, you are proven wrong: the &rsquo;efreet finds you! And he is not happy for the chase. He beats you, then strips you of your clothes and possessions. [S+1 / W-6 (Min: Beggar) / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You stop in an alley to catch your breath, but the &rsquo;efreet is there, waiting for you. &ldquo;Vengeance is mine!&rdquo; he shouts. You fumble in your robes and pull out a magical artifact. The &rsquo;efreet snarls, then disappears in a cloud of foul-smelling smoke. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
