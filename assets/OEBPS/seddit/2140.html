<p class="TaleDestiny">(2140) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You learn of a ruined city far off in the desert. None have explored this ancient place because a high stone wall surrounds it. The wall, unlike the city, seems impervious to the years. But an enormous set of iron portals breaks the wall. You set your will and your back against them and push them open. You begin to wander the streets, marveling at the odd buildings and the aged monuments. Before you&rsquo;ve gone two blocks, you are hopelessly lost. The broken walls and pitted streets seem to change position as soon as you turn a corner.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You traipse the city streets until you drop from exhaustion. You dream of an ancient people who faced a great hardship. With one voice, they beg a favor of you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: In time, you notice patterns in the movement of the roads and walls. You push on, ignoring your fatigue, piecing together the hints as they appear about you. In the end, you find yourself at an enormous open plaza in the center of the city. A throne stands intact, its cushions pristine. You rest on that throne and fall asleep. When you awake, you are in a wondrous place. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / Move to any Place of Power and have an immediate encounter]</p>
