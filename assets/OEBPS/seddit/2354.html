<p class="TaleDestiny">(2354) - WISDOM, SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You are in the market for a slave to help you in your travels. However, the choices available are few and expensive. You are turning to leave when you find standing in front of you a toothless, peck-marked man holding the arm of a veiled woman. &ldquo;I have what you need and it will not cost you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give some gold to him and lead your acquisition away. You don&rsquo;t get too far when you are confronted by the guards, accusing you of abduction. You say you bought the slave legitimately, but one of the guards was at the auction and doesn&rsquo;t recall this slave&rsquo;s being auctioned. The veiled woman affirms this by revealing herself to be an old hag&mdash;none would ever buy her as a slave. You are arrested, a victim of a con. [W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: While slave masters are not known to be good and decent people, you do know that there are rules for selling slaves, and approaching a buyer like this is against standards and practices. You hold onto your money and depart in haste. [Choice of Wisdom or Scholarship]</p>
