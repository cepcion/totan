<p>You discover that the other is quite suspicious of all strangers, and he seems to have a great grudge to bear against all.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You are able to alleviate his suspicions through a superb performance of hatred against those he himself hates. Completely taken in, he treats you like a member of the family. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
