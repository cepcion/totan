<p>You see a massive fleet of warships on the horizon. You know that you could never hope to fight so many, so you turn about and head for the nearest port.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It appears that the warfleet is planning to attack the port that you have chosen. You won&rsquo;t be able to reach them in time to warn them, so you decide that flight is a better option. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You arrive in port just a few hours in front of the approaching fleetThough there is little time, the Sultan is grateful for your warning and prepares his best defenses. Without the benefit of surprise, the warfleet is forced to withdraw. The Sultan rewards you with a hundred pieces of gold when the battle is over. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
