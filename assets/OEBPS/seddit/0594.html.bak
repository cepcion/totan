<p class="TaleDestiny">(594) - BEGUILING, BRASS TRUMPET  (M)</p>
<p>The girl is marvelously attractive, and seems trustworthy. The price is remarkably small.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You gladly buy her, but the next morning you wake to find her, and a substantial number of your possessions, gone. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You are suspicious of such a good deal and keep a careful eye on her. Before long, you have foiled three escape attempts, although you never resort to cruelly punishing her. When she realizes what a good soul you are, she decides to remain in your household. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> The clear note of the Brass Trumpet warns you of her untrustworthy nature, and you decide it would be best to pass her by. [D+1]</p>
