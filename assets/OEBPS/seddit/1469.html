<p class="TaleDestiny">(1469) - MARRIED  (M), APPEARANCE</p>
<p>To your great surprise, the other throws himself at your feet!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, MARRIED  (mandatory):</span> He begs for the right to bring you an evening of joy, and magnanimously you accept. The other is inexhaustible in his passion, and when the morning arrives, you have not slept, and are sore tired from the encounter&mdash;not that you would have taken all the gold in Persia in exchange. [D+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: He tells you of one he knows who will bring you great joy, and rushes to bring her to you. At the sight of you, she falls in a swoon, and you are likewise astounded by her beauty! The other departs, off to play match-maker with two others. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
