<p class="TaleDestiny">(1790) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, SPARKLING SPEAR, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>As you approach the famed Palace of 100 Closets, you are surprised to discover a young prince named Janshah sobbing by the side of the road. After some effort, he tells you his tale of love and sorrow. It seems his beloved is trapped in a secret room that he cannot approach due to the frightening &rsquo;efreet guarding the door. If he could find some way to evade the guardian, he and his lover could be free.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are moved to tears by his tale of woe and longing. You agree to distract the guardian long enough for the prince to reach his love. Sadly, an &rsquo;efreet is a powerful being, and not amused at being tricked thusly. He takes out his ire on you when he discovers your ploy.
