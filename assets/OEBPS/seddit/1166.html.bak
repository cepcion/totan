<p class="TaleDestiny">(1166) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You engage a barber. In five hours he cuts only half your hair, and he will not stop giving you the benefit of his wisdom. Finally you strike him and dash off into the street&mdash;but despite your blow, the man is right at your heels spouting advice.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You become the laughing stock of the neighborhood. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You stop and engage him in conversation, hoping to reveal him as a fool. Oddly, he turns out to be intelligent and well-versed. Your conversation is noticed by the Sultan, who invites the both of you to his palace for a banquet. [D+2 / S+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
