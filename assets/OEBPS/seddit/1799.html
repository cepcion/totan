<p class="TaleDestiny">(1799) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>The bandits are far too numerous to fight, and you&rsquo;ve run out of places to run. Your last hope lies in whoever inhabits the great pavilion up ahead. You run toward it, calling for help. You certainly never expected an incredibly tall black-skinned giant to step out and eclipse the noonday sun!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The giant is delighted that you have delivered so many fine meals directly to his door! He generously allows you to continue running away as he begins collecting brigands for his cookfire! You&rsquo;re not sure which foe you are more glad to leave behind you. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You have heard tales of this cannibal giant; perhaps the brigands have as well. Turning on your heel, you wave to the onrushing warriors and challenge them to help you against the mighty giant. After a long and costly battle, the giant is finally vanquished and the brigands much reduced in number. Fortunately, there is enough wealth in the giant&rsquo;s tent to satisfy their lust for riches, and they are too weary from battle to complain when you make your exit. [D+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
