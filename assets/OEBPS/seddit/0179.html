    <p class="TaleName">THE LAKE OF COLORS</p>

One of the fish breaks the surface, and says in a clear voice, "You are to be the one to save us!" Before you can respond, the fish is gone beneath the surface of the Lake of Colors. </p>
    <p>Along the far shore of the lake stands a grand city, like none you have ever before seen, and you go to it. The city is dark and forbidding: all the buildings are made of black basalt. From deep within one building you hear anguished moans; from another, a woman crying. </p>

    <p><span class="choice">Choice 3:</span> Investigate, but stay away from the inhabitants. Try to riddle out the mystery without endangering yourself.</p>
    <p>Which do you choose?</p>
