<p>You discover to your regret that the other was only pretending to be occupied. As you close in to strike a blow for justice, the other turns on you, quickly producing a blade.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: The other stops short at your visage. He does not believe someone so fine would be thinking to do him harm. You agree, saying that you thought that he was an old friend and you wanted to surprise him. You part without further incident. [D+2 / Luck]</p>
