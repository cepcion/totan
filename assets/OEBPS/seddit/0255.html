<p>The other leaps back from your attack, crying, &ldquo;Guards, guards!&rdquo; Suddenly there are armed men all around you. </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Resistance is useless, and you are taken. The other is furious, and orders you tortured until you repent. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Although resistance is useless, your reliance on force of arms is deeply ingrained. You fight back, and the results are unfortunate, as the guards wound you severely before they manage to disarm you. When you are finally subdued, the other orders you tortured and abandoned in the wilderness. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> As the guards lay hands on you, the Brass Trumpet peals forth a tremendous blast. The guards and the other fall to the ground clasping their ears, and you flee to safety. [D+1 / S+1]
