<p class="TaleDestiny">(1755) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Thank Allah that you were so near the Islands of Camphor when you fell so terribly ill! The healing uses of the camphor laurel are well known, and your good friend prince Taj el Mulouk has provided you with all you need for your recovery.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Princess Dunya, the beautiful wife of prince Taj, is a favorite of Allah, gifted with dreams of prophecy. Every day during your illness, she comes into your chamber to pray for your speedy recovery. After a few days, you return from the brink of death, no doubt due to her generous intervention. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Despite the prayers of princess Dunya, your illness extends many weeks. As your suffering grows deeper and deeper, your fevered mind is tormented by terrible dreams. When finally your fever breaks, you realize that the dreams were sent by the spirit of the late Sultan, and he has given you a task that you must complete. [D+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
