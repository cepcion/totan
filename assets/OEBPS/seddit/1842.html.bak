<p class="TaleDestiny">(1842) - APPEARANCE  (M)</p>
<p>You have decided to investigate the rumors you have heard of a fantastic creature known for its armored hide and a weapon for a snout. You know that you need a reliable guide if you are going to find the mythical creature.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The natives look at you with scorn and derision. They refuse to help you look for the rhinoceros. Angry at their poor treatment, you set out on your own. Before long you track down the rhino on your own. After watching the magnificent creature for an entire day, you return to civilization with a new tale to tell. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> The guide looks at you and decides that you would be useful on a rhino hunt. He leads you into the wilderness and asks you to call to the rhino with loud noises. You oblige, not realizing that your true role is rhino bait! At the last moment of the great creature&rsquo;s charge, you dive to the side while it rushes past you. Your treacherous guide is not as fast on his feet as you. His scream of terror tells you what his final fate was meant to be. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
