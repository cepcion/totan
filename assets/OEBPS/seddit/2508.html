<p class="TaleDestiny">(2508) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>The Sultan&rsquo;s son has gone missing and a reward is offered for any information on his whereabouts. You devote yourself to the task and, by luck, discover the errant royal among an order of Sufi dervishes who engage in frenetic meditation in the nearby hills. He has found his place in the world and wishes to remain. Touched by his devotion, you promise to speak on his behalf at his father&rsquo;s court.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are sincere, but fail to sway the Sultan, who tosses you in jail for bringing him news he so despises. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You speak long and eloquently about the grace of Allah and the path the Great One lays before each of his children. &ldquo;Perhaps the Most High feels that your son requires some time in divine communion in order to become a better ruler. Who are we to challenge or question His august plan?&rdquo; The Sultan is moved by your devotion and presentation and agrees to allow his son some time to follow his heart before returning to his duty. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
