<p class="TaleDestiny">(2119) - WEAPON USE, WISDOM</p>
<p>You spy a man extorting merchants and resolve to do something about it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You follow him for a while before he suddenly turns to you. &ldquo;Who do you think you follow, whelp?!&rdquo; He calls for nearby guards, who reveal to you that he is the Vizier! They do not let you ponder long your foolishness for following such an esteemed personage as they beat you cruelly. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You boldly approach the wicked one to have him pay for his crimes&mdash;but suddenly guards appear about his person! He is the Vizier! And though your weapons skill is beyond their abilities, they overwhelm you and bring you to the Sultan. The Sultan hears your side of the story, but esteems the Vizier so highly that he laughs you out of court and banishes you from his land. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You follow the man to a warehouse where his guards await and reveal him to be the Vizier. You decide to gather evidence of his transgressions rather than confront him out in the open. The merchants readily agree to act as witnesses against the wicked Vizier and with their testimony and other evidence, the Sultan orders the Vizier beheaded and appoints you in his place. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
