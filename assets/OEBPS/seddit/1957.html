<p class="TaleDestiny">(1957) - None</p>
<p>You are traveling along a rugged jungle path when you hear a cry for help. Investigating the call, you find yourself standing at the edge of a steep cliff. At the bottom is the wondrous Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard! Looking down, you see a man trapped at the bottom of the cliff. He tried to pull far too many tusks up the wall behind him, and when he fell he broke his leg. In his helpless condition, he could not prevent you from simply taking the ivory and leaving him for dead.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you help the man out of the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you help the man</span>: It takes you the rest of the day to find a safe way down and a gentle way to out of the pit. In the end, you are too exhausted to retrieve the ivory. You awake the next morning to find both man and ivory gone, but there is a mysterious item left on the bedroll the man had slept in. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not help</span>: You ignore the pleas and cries of the crippled man as you painstakingly remove the ivory from the pit. The last you hear from the man as you walk away is &ldquo;Allah rewards the generous.&rdquo; Once you get the ivory into the light, you discover that it is in reality worthless bone. You feel as though you have failed some kind of test. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
