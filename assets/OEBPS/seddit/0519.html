<p class="TaleDestiny">(519) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The aggressive grotesque chases you, cackling at your fright.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot escape him, as others in the crowd&mdash;friends or employees of the wicked one, perhaps&mdash;seem to be constantly tripping you up. Your plight brings great laughter to all who see it. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You draw the other into a deserted spot and proceed to thrash him soundly. You then extract an oath from him to leave proper folk unmolested. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
