<p class="TaleDestiny">(276) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>When setting out to rob the wealthy, one must expect to encounter superior safeguards against such nefarious activities. The other is well-prepared for your attempt to rob him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Not only do you fail, but you are captured. The Sultan deems it fitting that you be enslaved to your intended victim. [D+1 / Lose Stealth and Stealing / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Knowing the safeguards to be elaborate and powerful, you impersonate a servant sent to fetch an item for your imperious master. Your whining and pleading convince the guards, and you bear away a rich prize. [D+2 / Treasure]</p>
