<p>The middle of a volcanic eruption may not be the best time to negotiate a deal, but desperate men will often pay much when their situation is dire.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> In the end, you don&rsquo;t have the heart to add to the suffering of these unfortunate people. You agree to take them on board for free and barely escape the flaming island safely. [D+2]</p>
