<p>You hear a cry from inside the burning building! You struggle to enter the house amidst the smoke and flame.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The heat is too great, and within the house you can neither see nor breathe. In fear you retreat, coughing from the smoke you inhaled. [D+1]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Ignoring your burns and the choking smoke, you fight your way inside, where you find a beautiful maiden trapped in a burning room. You rescue her and she is most grateful.</p>
