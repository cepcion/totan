<p class="TaleDestiny">(1631) - PIETY</p>
<p>Over the course of your adventures, you have been stymied time and again by magic. When you meet the other, you see an opportunity to advance your knowledge of the arts mystical. You prostrate yourself before the other. He bids you stand. &ldquo;I have been presented with a riddle subtle and terrific, and I will suffer greatly if I cannot tease out the solution. &lsquo;Whom did Allah create from a mother but no father, and whom from a father but no mother?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hem and haw, but to no avail. As the words &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo; fall from your lips, the other gestures sadly, and you find yourself standing on a mountaintop, shivering in the cold and angry at yourself. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You laugh at the simple riddle. &ldquo;The first is Isa the Prophet, born of a virgin mother and no father; the second is Hawwa, the mother of all men, born from the flesh of Adama, the father of all men.&rdquo; Delight fills the face of the other, and because you have solved his problem, he agrees to teach you what you seek. It is hard going, but you persevere.
