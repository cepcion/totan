<p class="TaleDestiny">(803) - STEALTH AND STEALING  (M), PIETY</p>
<p>The soldier accepts your gold, pledging his services to you. However, he disappears one dark night.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, STEALTH AND STEALING  (mandatory):</span> Enraged, you pursue him, intent on punishing him for his treachery and greatly desiring the return of your gold, but never do you see him again. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You pray for him and leave word of your route before resuming your journey. Many days later he catches up with you and apologizes for his sudden departure, explaining that he left to pursue an old enemy, whom he miraculously defeated. He was told you prayed for his safety and, moved by your faith, swears to serve you and repay your trust. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / Weapon Use (1 use at Master level)]</p>
