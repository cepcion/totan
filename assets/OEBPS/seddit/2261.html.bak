<p>The other may be enchanted, but that makes his riches no less attractive.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other notices your clumsy attempt to rob him of his coins. He utters a curse powered by the enchantment wrapping him. You feel its effects grab hold as you run away with his coin purse in your hand. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You swipe the other&rsquo;s purse without his being any the wiser. Later, when you are safely carrying the ill-gotten gains, you realize that some of the other&rsquo;s enchantment has rubbed off on the purse. [D+1 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
