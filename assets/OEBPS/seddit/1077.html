<p class="TaleDestiny">(1077) - MAGIC</p>
<p>In a shopkeeper&rsquo;s stall, you have discovered an intricately carved necklace. A lovely lady also has her eye on the item and is willing to pay more.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait until she is alone then try to rob her. She turns on you, and you are struck dumb by the force of her power. &ldquo;Poor fool,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;These gems are potent magical artifacts.&rdquo; She casually demonstrates on your body, warping you from human form. Your mind is equally warped by the greed you feel for the gems. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You sense the aura of the gems on the necklace as the lady takes and handles them, and you realize that she must be a powerful enchantress. Prudently you make yourself scarce. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
