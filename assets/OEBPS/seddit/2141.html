<p class="TaleDestiny">(2141) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You are being chased by gools intent on slaking their thirst with your blood. Frantically searching for somewhere to make a stand, you top a rise and see a ruined city spread before you. Running among the crumbling buildings, you notice a pair of strangely preserved wooden doors. Perhaps this is a place to hide! You open one of the doors and step through, emerging in an entirely different section of the city. There two other wooden doors await you. Pausing to catch your breath, you hear a chime. A gool steps through the doorway after you. You push through one of the other doors and again find yourself transported to another area within the ruins. Another two doors present themselves.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Quick Thinking</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Scholarship</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: You rush blindly around the city, unable to make sense of the doorway transport. In time, you arrive at the edge of the ruins. You flee back into the wilderness, leaving the gools far behind. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: You carefully note your surroundings each time you open a door. In time, you discern a pattern. You understand how to move about the city quickly.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Your superior knowledge of the doors allows you to escape the gools, but your honor and piety demand more. These monsters must be destroyed. You return to the areas where the gools hunt. When their hunger drives them to separate, you lay traps and ambush the isolated beasts. Your prowess soon ends their lives. In this way, you rid the place of the horrors. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</li>
