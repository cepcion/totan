<p class="TaleDestiny">(2183) - None</p>
<p>Watching the flames dance across the deck, you reach for a drink. However, an enraged companion strips the last of your water from you and pours it on the fires in a feeble attempt to put them out. Now you are both thirsty and angry. In a fit of rage, you throw the man into the fire. After his death, you feel the weight of your actions on your shoulders, and you exile yourself from the kingdom.
