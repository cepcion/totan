<p class="TaleDestiny">(1413) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You approach the other to ask a favor while he examines a strange object. Somehow you manage to inadvertently give offense to him. &ldquo;Idiot!&rdquo; he thunders. Fuming, he summons a lesser jinni to him, and orders it, &ldquo;Take this fool anywhere; just get him out of my sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The jinni carries you to lands unknown. [D+1 / S+1 / Have another player move you to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The jinni carries you away, but you smile, for in the other&rsquo;s fury, he failed to notice you pilfering the very object he was examining. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure / Have another player move you to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
