<p class="TaleDestiny">(2380) - DENDAN OIL</p>
<p>A string of robberies has been plaguing the area, and luckily you have spotted the culprit&mdash;a merman!&mdash;depositing his ill-gotten goods in a nearby lake. Patiently, you sit watching until he re-emerges from the water and heads off. Then you dive in, carrying as much as you can from his makeshift home.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You return some of the treasure to the victims, but keep the bulk of it for yourself. [W+2 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DENDAN OIL</span>: You return all the treasure to their respective owners, and are even left with something for yourself. The people applaud your actions. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
