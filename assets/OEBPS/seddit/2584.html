<p class="TaleDestiny">(2584) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>While out walking, you are accosted by a quick youth in shabby clothes, who swings an ornate scimitar. He has heard of your exploits and challenges you to a duel. You dart your eyes about and see some distance away a giant of a man, clad in the robe of a dervish, swirling a sword around his head and chanting prayers. You rush to the dervish.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You say, &ldquo;I will give a sack of gold if you fight in my stead.&rdquo; The giant shakes his head. &ldquo;With the sword, I invoke the One God. It would be sacrilege to turn it against a man for vanity or gold.&rdquo; You slink back to the youth, who shows you no mercy. Your reputation and confidence both suffer. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You say, &ldquo;That youth has blasphemed against the One God, cursed the name of the Prophet, and sworn to worship fire demons in the ruins of our mosque! Help me defeat him!&rdquo; The giant narrows his eyes and strides to the attack. While the youth is distracted, you sneak behind him and brain him with a rock. Examining his sword, you find it is most wondrous. [D+1 / S+1 / Thunderbolt Sword]</p>
