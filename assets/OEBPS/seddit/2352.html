<p class="TaleDestiny">(2352) - None</p>
<p>While walking through the busy marketplace, you are approached by a veiled woman. She gives you a purse of gold and begs you to buy her at the slave market. Sure enough, when you arrive there, she is up for auction&mdash;and the bidding escalates quickly. You look into the purse&mdash;there are easily a hundred gold coins here, a fortune for a slave! You easily outbid everyone, including a scowling man in rich robes. The slave says quietly, &ldquo;Thank you for saving me from that monster. He had me sold as a slave only to buy me to make it legal. My father will reward you handsomely&mdash;but you must watch your back as you have acquired a powerful enemy.&rdquo; [S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (MERCHANT)]</p>
