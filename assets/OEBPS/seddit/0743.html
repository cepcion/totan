<p class="TaleDestiny">(743) - WILDERNESS LORE, SCHOLARSHIP, BEAST FORM  (M)</p>
<p>You marvel at the sight of the black waters churned to a froth beneath the ship. You cast a bucket in the water and haul it up, and discover it to be full of tiny black fish.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They are obviously the cause of the disturbance, and not very interesting. [Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize these as the favorite food of the dendan. From your studies, you know the dendan can be slain by the shout of men, so you raise a great cry. Soon, a huge shape floats to the surface. The dendan is taken aboard and rendered for fat and bone, and you take a fair share of the earnings of the sale of the corpse and a vial of its most marvelous oil. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)/ Dendan Oil]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEAST FORM  (mandatory):</span> Abruptly, a huge dark shape becomes apparent in the water, feeding on the tiny fishes. You recognize it as a dendan, the giant sea creature which is poisoned by human flesh and killed by the sound of the voice of a true human. You begin to call out loudly, but it appears that in your transformed state that whatever virtue your voice had is lost. The creature swings its mighty head against the side of your ship, starting leaks below decks and casting you over the side and into its gigantic maw. You are quickly devoured, but you may take comfort in the fact that, upon your demise, your body reverts to the form it had at your birth. With a gulletful of human flesh, the creature is poisoned, and rises belly-first to the surface. You cease to be, but are remembered long after for having rid the sea of a great menace.
