<p class="TaleDestiny">(1493) - MAGIC</p>
<p>Girding yourself, you draw steel and demand the other surrender his coins or his life. The other rolls his eyes and dismisses your threat with a wave of his hand and a word of potent magic.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The spell warps your body and mind, leaving you dazed and changed. The touch of magic leaves its mark upon you. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You counter the other&rsquo;s magic with your own potent spells. Intrigued, the other engages you in a duel of sorcery. Your battle is witnessed, and even though in the end you are defeated by a foe whose respect you have earned, the story of your might spreads. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
