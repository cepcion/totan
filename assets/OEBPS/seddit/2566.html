<p class="TaleDestiny">(2566) - None</p>
<p>As you lay under a shady date tree, you see two people approaching through the noon haze. One of them is a beautiful young woman, and her interlocutor is a badly-scarred hulk of a man with one missing eye and a noticeable limp. The woman insists that taking care of oneself is the most important thing one can do to live a good life; the other argues that experience and risk make a good life. As they pass, they see you sitting and approach you for your opinion on the subject. You offer them a task to prove whose method is the most effective. Paying them a gold coin each, you tell them of a cave that you had come to investigate nearby in which was said to be a great treasure guarded by an enchantress. Whomever&rsquo;s methods work to gain you her secret treasure, you shall judge to be the most beneficial.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Storytelling</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;3: They do not buy your story, and consider you a fool for wasting their time. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4&ndash;7: The scarred man returns, holding a valuable treasure glittering in the sunlight. He presents it to you, and you declare him the winner of the contest. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8&ndash;11: The beautiful woman returns, telling you that the story was just a myth. A lonely old herbalist lives in that cave, who was more than happy to have the company of such a nice person. You declare the maiden the winner and visit the herbalist yourself; she turns out to be a skilled healer. [D+2 / You may lose one status of your choice]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">12+: You wait the entire day and neither finds the way to your lonely tree. As you are about to go investigate, a stunningly beautiful woman appears as if out of a mirage. &ldquo;You sent your servants to steal from me, and now you shall join them in their fate!&rdquo; Before you have a chance to react, you find yourself bound by a magical chain and then sold to the next passing traveler. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</li>
