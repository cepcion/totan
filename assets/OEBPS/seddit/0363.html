<p class="TaleDestiny">(363) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You see your intended victim enter a house, and you wait until full darkness to enter. As you step forward a youthful voice whispers, &ldquo;ls that you, Mizah, my love?&rdquo; It is apparently the child of the owner of the house, preparing to elope with the other!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With all this activity it would be far too dangerous to try anything here tonight! Praise Allah you were warned. What a stroke of luck! [D+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You disguise your voice and coax the other into a rendezvous at a distant location. You then climb up the ladder the other has left and make quite a haul. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
