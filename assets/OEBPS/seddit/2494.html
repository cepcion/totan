<p class="TaleDestiny">(2494) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You are approached by one who is determined to win the love of another. The other says, &ldquo;My beloved&rsquo;s family does not approve, but I believe the fates guide us. I know that you are one who believes that love conquers all, and I have taken it onto myself to sell your livestock to pay for a generous dowry to sway her parents.&rdquo; Enraged, you strike the other. Then you go to reclaim your goods.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have limited success, alas&mdash;the family has already spent most of what they received. [D-1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Despite your actions, the other&rsquo;s affection only deepens. You are astounded by the love they show and you wonder how you could ever have stood in their way. You work out a plan whereby the other will work for you after the marriage to repay the dowry, and all hail you for your kindness. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
