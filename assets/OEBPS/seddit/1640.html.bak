<p>The other rules a prosperous city and has been known to provide patronage to those whom he deems worthy. You are invited to an extravagant dinner party so that he may meet you and judge whether he should lend you his support. One of the other dinner guests mentions to you in secret that the other insists on all his guests&rsquo; showing proper behavior at all times. Even the slightest faux pas could ruin your chances for aid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try your best to remain polite, but you simply lack the proper training to pass for a member of the upper echelons of society.
