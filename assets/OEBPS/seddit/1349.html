<p class="TaleDestiny">(1349) - MAGIC</p>
<p>The city is silent, with no inhabitants to be found. In the lake are fish of yellow, red, blue and white (the colors of Jews, Magians, Christians, and Muslims of a typical city).</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The fish here are as silent as fish anywhere. So much for that tale.
[D+2 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You conjure the fish to speak. &ldquo;Our Queen,&rdquo; they say, &ldquo;was unfaithful to our King. When he punished her, she cast a spell, turning us into fish. In yon palace she weeps for her lost lover.&rdquo; You find her there, mad with grief. You end her misery with a sword, and the people are restored, and they lavish gifts upon you. [D+3 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>] / Treasure ]</p>
