<p class="TaleDestiny">(292) - APPEARANCE  (M)</p>
<p>The other places his arm around a hairless ape which travels with him. &ldquo;My friend has been trapped in a beast&rsquo;s form by an evil sorcerer. Until someone kisses these ugly lips, my friend will remain a wretched beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are willing to try.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Acting and Disguise</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wilderness Lore</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Bargaining and Evaluation</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: You cannot bring yourself to kiss an ape. The enchantment remains. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: You manage a formal peck on the lips of the beast, and it is transformed into a rather ugly maiden&mdash;who immediately falls in love with you.</li>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are not Married</span>: The attentions of the maiden, who clings to you like a vine to a tree, bring howls of laughter from those around, and you are the butt of jokes for months after. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are Married</span>: You quickly protest that you are already married, and the maiden gathers what little dignity she has and departs. [D+1 / S+1]</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> Your vanity makes the very thought of kissing an ape revolting to you. You beat the other and his ape (which gives you a nasty bite). Unfortunately, the wound heals slowly, and infects. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / Roll 1 die: On a l or 2, Diseased]</p>
