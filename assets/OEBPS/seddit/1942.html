<p class="TaleDestiny">(1942) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You learn that the palace is overseen by a twin brother and sister, trusted by the king yet wary of each other. Perhaps if you could win one of them over to your cause, you could take advantage of their mutual distrust to gain access.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Taking great effort to make yourself appear genuine, you approach first the brother, then the sister. You quickly learn, however, that their loyalty to their king is too strong for you to turn them against him. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Using your wiles and charms, you are able to convince one of the twins to confide in you. The work is difficult, as he has very high standards and is very loyal to his king. But you finally achieve your goal and enter the Crystal Palace by the side of your new companion. [D+1 / S+1 / Appearance]</p>
