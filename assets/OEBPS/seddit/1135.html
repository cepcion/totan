<p class="TaleDestiny">(1135) - WEAPON USE, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You know the other to be quite powerful. This does not discourage you, for the most powerful have the best treasure. You sneak into the other&rsquo;s chambers while he is away&mdash;ready to take whatever you find of interest.</p>
<p>A servant finds you snooping and catches you by the clothes.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may either attack him or plea for leniency:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you attack</span>:</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The servant is not ready for a fight. His authoritative demeanor does not withstand an actual encounter; he immediately cowers to the floor. Before you can press your advantage you hear guards approaching. You flee empty-handed. [S+1]</li>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You quickly turn on the servant and lock his arm behind him&mdash;your knife at his throat. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t kill me! Please don&rsquo;t kill me!&rdquo; he cries&mdash;apparently unschooled in the custom of being quiet when under a knife. You shove him down and grab the nearest thing as you rush out of the palace. [S+1 / Treasure]</li>
</ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you plea for leniency</span>:</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The servant boxes your ears and says as if to a two-year-old, &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve been very bad and you know it.&rdquo; You see that the servant is no match for you and decide to rise up against him. As you do you meet the hilt of a sword at the back of your head. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You make a case to the servant that he is unappreciated by his master&mdash;that he deserves more and should help you to steal some of his master&rsquo;s possessions. He gives the proposal serious thought&mdash;turning from you long enough for you to knock him over the head with a brass statue&hellip; a very nice brass statue. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Brass Horseman]</li>
