<p>Leaning against a tree is a man feverish from poison. It is clear that he will soon expire if you do not aid him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Using your knife, you cut open the wound so you can suck the poison out before it kills the man. You treat him with some herbs in your bag. Though it takes two days before he is coherent enough to speak, you see that he will eventually recover in full. In exchange for your unexpected aid, he offers to guide you to the location of a long-lost fortune. [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0179.html#TaleHeader">Lake of Colors</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You know that it is too late to save this man with simple medicine, so you use your mystical arts to save his life. When the devout dervish learns what you have done on his behalf, he curses you for corrupting his body with your black magic! [S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
