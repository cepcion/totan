<p>The other eyes you with disapproval as you give him a wide berth.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;You think that you can just pass a noble and powerful being such as I? You shall wish you did not insult me so.&rdquo; [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The other thinks you must be a powerful wizard and avoids you as well. [Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The other calls to you by name, and you turn to face him. In his hands is a bag of gold. &ldquo;I believe you dropped this, did you not?&rdquo; You say that you did not, and the other is impressed with your honesty, and gives you a blessing before departing.
