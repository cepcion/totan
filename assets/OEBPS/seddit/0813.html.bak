<p>The soldier is traveling in your direction and agrees to accompany you. Soon after, you are waylaid by a troop of vengeful soldiers. Their leader points to your companion and asks you, &ldquo;Do you travel with this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fearful, you deny it. [Go to paragraph <a href="1394.html#TaleHeader">1394</a>.]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, WEAPON USE</span>: With not the slightest fear, you say that you do, and the band of thugs draw their swords and rush you. Your companion cries out in fury and hurls himself forward, his blade tracing complex patterns through the air, and you stand at his back and join the fray. Though the fight is desperate, you are victorious, as much by luck as by the skill of your blade. Your companion is grateful for your aid, and wishes to accompany you as your bodyguard.
