<p class="TaleDestiny">(814) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The soldier laughs in your face and observes that a man with his skill and renown would hardly serve one like you. He launches into a tirade about your worthlessness, full of degrading comments on matters of a most intimate nature.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: This public mockery shames you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You endure the soldier&rsquo;s coarse jests with dignity. In quiet tones, you express your disdain for his lack of manners and breeding, and conclude that no more can be expected from one of his low kind. Finally, in an explosion of insults, he departs. Others rush to you and praise you for your calm defense against the loathsome harangue, and they congratulate your courage in standing up to this bully. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
