<p class="TaleDestiny">(2228) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Despite the other&rsquo;s terrible predictions, and seemingly tireless enthusiasm to espouse them, you see in him something worthy of audience.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Amidst the other&rsquo;s rants and predictions, there is mention of a holy hermit and the location of his cave. Curious to see what kind of holy man might lead to such an outlook, you set your sight on visiting the man. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Encouraged by your attention, the other hounds your steps for days on end. In order to avoid subjecting random strangers to the other&rsquo;s gloom, you head into the wilderness. In short order the hardships prove too much for the other and he begs you to lead him back to civilization. You are rewarded by a strained half-smile and unenthusiastic &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; when you part ways. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
