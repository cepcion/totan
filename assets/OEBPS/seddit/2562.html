<p class="TaleDestiny">(2562) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>A hated rival, and a well-respected warrior, has just been appointed a city magistrate. You are certain that this man will use his newfound power to have you arrested and jailed. Before that can happen, you sneak into his home and abduct him. You ride out into the wilderness, intending to leave the miserable one to his fate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In your haste to humble your rival, you failed to pack enough supplies or note your route. You get lost and must rely on your rival to lead you back to civilization. Not only are your plans ruined, you are now in your rival&rsquo;s debt. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You make your way through the barren landscape, hiding your trail and losing the pursuit. You laugh heartily as you ride off, your rival tied to a dead tree. [D+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
