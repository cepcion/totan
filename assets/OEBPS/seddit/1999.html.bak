<p class="TaleDestiny">(1999) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You happen into an inn where three dark-cloaked strangers are huddled in a corner. You sit nearby and surreptitiously listen in. They are discussing a scheme to separate a noble from his purse by offering a horse enchanted to look healthy when it is not. When they depart, you follow at a safe distance. When they arrive at meeting place with the animal, you quickly make your way to the noble&rsquo;s side. You explain the true intent of the thieves.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The noble joins the strangers in condemning you for interfering in business that does not concern you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: With a snap of your fingers, you dispel the glamour on the beast and reveal it a crippled old nag. The noble charges the thieves with fraud and invites you to his home for an extended visit. [D+2 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
