<p class="TaleDestiny">(1372) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You watch in awe as a battle takes place below you. Bolts of magic are hurled back and forth. Weapons of great power wreak destruction, and the screams of the dying burn your ears.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Later, you attempt to tell this tale to others, but words seem inadequate to capture the scene. Even your feeble attempts are met with great interest, but you know that the truth was much greater. [D+2 / S+2 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: In the lands of mankind, you tell the tale as you felt it, livening the telling with well-chosen anecdotes and parables. Yours is accounted among the greatest stories ever told, and the powerful come from leagues away to listen at your feet. [D+3 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
