<p class="TaleDestiny">(2463) - WEAPON USE  (M), MAGIC</p>
<p>The twisted hunchback lunges at the poor nightingale, forcing it roughly into an overcrowded cage with many more of its kind. Their mournful cries break your heart; you are determined that they be free. But the mean hunchback refuses to release them, even when you offer him great riches!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Angered by his rudeness, you strike the hunchback a vicious blow, sending him staggering. While he is stunned, you quickly free the beautiful birds and they make their escape.
[D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You see that only one punishment would be adequate for such a foul brute. Incanting terrible words, you transform the hunchback into a bird just like those he has snared. Forcing him into the cage, you look for a suitable owner to sell him to. [D+1 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation / Lose Piety]</p>
