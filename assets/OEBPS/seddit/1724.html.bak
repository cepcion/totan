<p>Even paranoid kings leave their palaces from time to time. You follow the king and his guards as they go hunting one afternoon, hoping to learn more about the palace and its inhabitants.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After trudging through the wilderness for hours, the group unexpectedly encounters a wild boar! The beast charges, slashing right and left with its razor-tipped tusks. The king&rsquo;s horse rears in terror, throwing him to the ground. Without hesitation, you leap into the clearing and pull the king to safety while his guards make short work of the creature. Grateful for your selfless act, the king rewards you with a few of his crystal trinkets. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
