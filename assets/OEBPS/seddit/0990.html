<p class="TaleDestiny">(990) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You spy a blind old man and reflect aloud on your blessings.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The old man hears your words and is understandably offended. &ldquo;Yes, it would be too bad if you were also so afflicted, you dog!&rdquo; He swings wildly at you with his stick. Others snicker at you as you take your leave, the man&rsquo;s curses sounding in your ears. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your observation is couched in polite and poetic verse. Those around you conclude you are a wise philosopher. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
