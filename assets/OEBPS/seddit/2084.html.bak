<p>It took an hour of waiting just to gain audience with the captain, and you had to pay for the privilege, but finally you are sitting face to face with the man. &ldquo;Where is the Golden Cup of the Twice-Blind Caliph?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;I must have it!&rdquo; The captain slowly unwraps his turban, and there it is&mdash;the Golden Cup&mdash;resting upon his very head the whole time!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It costs you everything you have, but the Cup is yours at last!
[D+2 / S+1 / W-5 (Min: Beggar) / Magic]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: &ldquo;You do not have enough gold to buy this,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But&hellip; if you best me in a duel, I will simply give it to you. Free of charge.&rdquo; You fight with inspiration and emerge victorious, but when the captain hands you the cup, his masculine features shimmer and flow into those of the opposite sex&hellip; as do yours! [D+1 / S+2 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
