<p class="TaleDestiny">(1208) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You awaken to a most puzzling sight: all the metal objects in your caravan are moving by themselves toward a distant point.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Suddenly, the metal flies toward a distant mountain. Your sword, belt, and coins carry you with them! You strike the mountain and fall unconscious. When you awaken, you struggle free from your garments and limp back to your camp, gather what remains, and move away from this strange land. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You know a strong magnetic force is nearby and quickly shed all your metal objects. Thanking Allah, you move the caravan away from this accursed area before you have lost all you own. [D+2 / S+1 / W-1
(Min: Respectable) / Quick Thinking]</p>
