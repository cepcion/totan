<p class="TaleDestiny">(1117) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You come to an ancient road, overgrown with weeds and grass. Curious, you follow it to the walls of an ancient city. Though the walls are crumbling in places, you see activity within.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Soldiers of the city find you and bring you before their magistrate. He mentions the wisdom of Solomon; your comment that Solomon has been dead for thousands of years is greeted with disbelief. You are judged to be insane and are confined for your own protection.
