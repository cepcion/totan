<p class="TaleDestiny">(2009) - PIETY</p>
<p>You awaken one night to find a group of horrid goolehs closing in about you. You gaze over their numbers and understand you cannot run from your fate tonight. Rising to your knees, you cast your gaze to the heavens, and exclaim, &ldquo;Allah, praise be to you! The wonders of your creation are manifest for all to see, and I thank you for granting me such a singular sight!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The pack is unimpressed by your words. They fall upon you and your shrieks fill the night. After a time, they leave you, barely alive and bleeding heavily. Moments later, a healer appears, drawn by your screams. Over the next several weeks, he nurses you back to health, but he requires a task from you in return. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: The deadly horde is taken aback by the strength of your faith. A few are so moved that they clamor that you be left alone. Others are not so forgiving and sharp words are exchanged. One monster strikes another, and the pack dissolves into a massive fray. When several gooleh fall to claw and fang, the rest consume them in their frenzy. Sated, the survivors skulk off into the night. [D+2 / S+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
