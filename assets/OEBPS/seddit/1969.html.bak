<p class="TaleDestiny">(1969) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>Attempting to pass through a busy channel, you find yourself trapped between two massive warfleets. You realize that escape is impossible, for there is craggy shore to the left and the right. You decide that your best chance for survival is to offer your services to one of the two fleets and hope for victory. Praise be to Allah, it is the Caliph&rsquo;s own fleet you have joined!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Sadly, your small vessel is no match for the mighty ships that clash this day, and it is quickly smashed by the rains of the rebellious prince&rsquo;s fleet. But no one can resist the might of the Caliph, and by the end of the day the rebels are sunk or in flight. Saving you from drowning, the admiral offers to compensate you for your loss. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: A small vessel like yours benefits from a very shallow draft, while the massive warships of the rebel fleet must sit very low in the water to sustain their weight. Using this fact to your advantage, you lure a number of rebel ships into the shallows near the shore, leaving them stranded and helpless as the Caliph&rsquo;s ships press their advantage.
