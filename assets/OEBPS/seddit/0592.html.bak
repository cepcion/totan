<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The asking price is very moderate for a slave of his intelligence.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may buy the slave for 1 wealth level if your wealth is Respectable or greater:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you buy the slave</span>: The slave&rsquo;s business acumen is excellent; eventually, he buys his own freedom, but not before helping you in your dealings. [W-1 (Min: Rich) / Bargaining and Evaluation at Master level]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: The slave goes for a high price, and you later hear that he has increased his master&rsquo;s already formidable wealth. [Bargaining and Evaluation]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SULTAN, VIZIER, RESPECTED, ROBE OF HONOR  (All mandatory)</span>: None dare bid against you, for fear of insulting one so highly placed. The slave master decides to cut his losses by giving the slave to you as a gift. You get the slave for free and learn much of the world of trade from his vast experience. Eventually, though, the Ender of Stories takes him to his grave. [Bargaining and Evaluation at Master level]</p>
