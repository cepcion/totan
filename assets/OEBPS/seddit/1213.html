<p class="TaleDestiny">(1213) - FATED  (M), BRASS BOW</p>
<p>The horrible tales of the magnetic mountain impel you to challenge its menace. You go to a local astrologer for advice.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He foretells disaster. You must give up your ambition. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED  (mandatory):</span> He foretells success and gives you a thing of power. Armed with the great Brass Bow, you approach the mountain. [Brass Bow / Read the Brass Bow paragraph below]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS BOW</span>: You approach the mountain until you feel the faintest of tugs. Then, you carefully aim and fire. The arrow, drawn by the magnet, describes a straight and true course to the giant bell atop the mountain; with a tremendous crash the mountain crumbles, as though Allah&rsquo;s fist destroyed it. Your heroism is hailed throughout the land, and you are showered with wealth recovered from the mountain. [D+3 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
