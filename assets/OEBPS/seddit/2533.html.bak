<p class="TaleDestiny">(2533) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>As you walk through a large, bustling village, trying to sell your wares, you are grabbed by a meaty, sand-scarred hand. That hand is attached to a large man, who has at least three friends behind him. Confused, you are dragged in front of a local merchant, a slovenly, brutal man. &ldquo;So this is the famed traveler about whom I have heard so much? Well, we have rules here: you need a license to sell merchandise in this town. What have you to say for yourself?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You begin to stammer and stutter, then bow down in abject apology. After a few moments of this, the merchant leans back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he will cause us any more trouble. Remove him from my sight!&rdquo; The thug who brought you here now tosses you ignobly into the dusty street. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You bow down in a show of respect and play to the man&rsquo;s ego. He shakes his head in disbelief, &ldquo;So you think you can sway me with sweet words and hollow praise? Well, let&rsquo;s see if a few months working in the mines doesn&rsquo;t whittle your tongue!&rdquo; [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
