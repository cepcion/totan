<p class="TaleDestiny">(2282) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The other is wealthy beyond your dreams. There seems to be no way to punish him for his deeds. You cannot get past his guards, and you cannot muster the connections to discredit him. You decide that your only hope is to wait in the woods to try to catch him hunting.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait for weeks and finally decide to give up on the endeavor. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You wait for weeks, but the other never seems to actually go hunting. But it is not a complete loss: you have gotten to know the area quite well in the time you have spent here. [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
