<p class="TaleDestiny">(1966) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You have learned that a large warfleet is planning to attack your beloved city. You alone could never hope to disrupt such a mighty invasion, but you think you know a magician who could.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The magician is annoyed by your demands, for he cannot be bothered by such worldly concerns. To get rid of your interference, he casts a spell on you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: At first, the magician wants nothing to do with you or your concerns. But when you describe the gratitude that the Sultan will have for the one who saves the city, a gleam of desire shines in his eye. He agrees to summon a storm that will scatter the invading fleet. [D+1 / Seduction]</p>
