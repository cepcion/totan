<p class="TaleDestiny">(503) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>A mere glance at the twisted visage causes you to recoil in horror and disgust. You gather yourself up and offer a polite apology for your shameful act to the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Grudgingly he accepts your apology, and goes on his way. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: The other is placated by your tremendous apology and tells you the story of how he was disfigured. When he was young, he was bitten by a poisonous serpent in the Valley of Diamonds. He warns you against assaying it yourself, but when you press him for more information, he tells you how to go there.
