<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You cry out the names graven on the Seal Ring of the Prophet Solomon, and you are freed; then you turn his attack against him, and delight to see him turned into an ape, unable to speak. You drive the ape away, and never hear of him again. Word of your great victory spreads throughout the world and none bothers you in the future.
