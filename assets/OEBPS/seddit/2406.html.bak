<p class="TaleDestiny">(2406) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>Your eyes sting from gazing upon the otherworldly beauty in front of you. You fall to your knees and bow low, forehead touching the floor. Then, with carefully chosen words, plead for the &rsquo;efreeteh to allow herself to be seen by other mortals. She is deeply moved by your speech and manner.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: She grabs your chin, lifts your head up, and bestows a burning kiss upon your forehead. Your face is suffused with a glow that stays with you for many weeks. [D+1 / Appearance]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> You lift your head up and she approaches you&mdash;but she stops, an unseen force preventing her from coming any closer. A look of sadness passes across her face; then she throws you a kiss and disappears. [D+1]</p>
