<p class="TaleDestiny">(1701) - MAGIC  (M), COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>As you pass through this town, you are amazed to find a traveling show from deepest India! You hasten yourself to enter the largest of the tents and discover therein a pair of elephants trained to the harness like horses! To see those great creatures serving as the docile mount of a wrinkled old man, now that was something you never expected!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The aged magician commands the elephant to kneel and carefully dismounts with the assistance of the animal&rsquo;s trunk. Approaching your camp, he accepts your offer of hot food and wine. He tells you the marvelous tale of how he came to befriend the brute and offers to teach you all the secrets of raising and caring for such animals.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC  (mandatory):</span> Surely this is a mighty magician, come to do you harm! Before he can open his mouth to speak, you let loose with your most powerful spells and charms. When the smoke clears, both man and elephant have vanished. You certainly have an interesting tale to tell! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You recognize the man as a wise and learned shaykh, and bowing before him you press your forehead to the ground in respect. He gingerly dismounts from the elephant and orders you to rise. Taking a seat by your fire, he enjoys your hospitality and tells you his tale. Recognizing the nobility within you, he explains that he is near the end of his life and has sought a worthy soul to entrust with his most precious possession. [D+1 / S+1 / Copper Drum]</p>
