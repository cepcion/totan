<p class="TaleDestiny">(2227) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Seeing in the other great wisdom beneath his prophecies of catastrophe, you strive to court his favor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You spend time in discourse with the other and listen to long rants on the oncoming doom of the world. In between the tales of inevitable destruction and unavoidable horror, you manage to pry free some little gems of wisdom. [S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The tumult of gloom that continuously pours from the other abounds with bits and pieces of a moral tale worthy of the ages. After the long hours of ranting are concluded, you go off to ponder your fate. You find yourself with a strangely uplifted spirit. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
