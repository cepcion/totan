<p>As you kneel before the other, he begs you for assistance in saving his family from a gang of ruthless bandits. You follow him into the wilderness to the bandit&rsquo;s lair. Once arriving at the spot, it becomes clear that the other is in league with the bandits, and there was no family at all. This was simply a lure to get you into an ambush, taking advantage of your generous nature. You strike out at the other to make him pay.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you are quick to gain revenge on the one who tricked you, the other bandits quickly work to incapacitate and rob you. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: After taking out the one who tricked you, you proceed to use your dazzling sword skills to make short work of the amateur robbers. They flee from your skilled swordsmanship, and you recover some of the monies they have taken from previous victims. [D+1 / W+1
