<p class="TaleDestiny">(1668) - MAGIC</p>
<p>To repay a debt to one who freed him from a curse, the other is preparing a great feast for all those of this land who cannot afford to feed themselves. You offer your services to help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You spend many a long and demanding hour, guiding the other&rsquo;s efforts to assure that the needs of all are met. The smiling faces of the people fill your heart with glee, and you know that nothing will deter you from your journey from now on as long as you have this memory. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Adding your arcane skills to those of the other, all goes much smoother and faster: yet it is nothing compared to the thanks you receive by feeding the hungry. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
