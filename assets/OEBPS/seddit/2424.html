<p class="TaleDestiny">(2424) - None</p>
<p>As you ride across the plain, you see a dark cloud of winged creatures turn and dive towards a lone wildebeest. To your shock and horror, the unfortunate animal is overcome almost instantly, reduced to no more than stripped bones. Your heart stops as the cloud turns and heads straight for you!</p>
<p>You know that you have no hope of survival without the aid of Allah, so you drop to your knees and begin to pray fervently.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Piety</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;2: The creatures attack you viciously, tearing at your hands and face. To your amazement, they let you live, but the damage will take a long time to heal. [S+1 / Lose Appearance / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">3+: Praise be to Allah, for he is merciful! The instant before the creatures strike, they notice another wildebeest in the distance. Apparently, they prefer wildebeest to human meat. [D+1 / Piety]</li>
</ul>
