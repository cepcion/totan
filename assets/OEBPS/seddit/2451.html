<p class="TaleDestiny">(2451) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Making your way up the treacherous mountain path, you are shocked to hear a thunderous roar from above you. Fearing an avalanche, you leap aside as a monstrous egg rolls past you!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Curious to see what happens, you follow the egg down the mountainside to find it smashed on the rocks. Perhaps the remains of the shell will fetch some coins at market. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You remember tales of the roc, the largest birds in the world, and the gems they often build their nests with. Knowing that the egg must have come from a nest, you creep up the mountainside. Distressed by the missing egg, the mother roc takes little notice as you grab a bagful of shining rubies and make your escape. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely)]</p>
