<p class="TaleDestiny">(2071) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>While you travel with a tribal caravan, an ugly inter-family dispute erupts. Before long, a duel is soon in the offing. One of the two duelists, however, is very sickly. Tribal law allows an outsider to step in as a champion for one of the two sides.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;I will champion his cause,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;But if I am to risk my life for another&rsquo;s honor, I must be compensated.&rdquo; The family gathers together a fair sum to pay you. Then, with that money in hand, you bribe the other fellow to throw the fight to you. Unfortunately, in his attempt to make the fight convincing, he runs his sword through your leg before conceding. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Where others see a threat, you see an opportunity. When handed your blade, you refuse it. &ldquo;Today, we mend the wounds of the spirit not by making wounds of the flesh, but by speaking as men.&rdquo; You arrange a series of payments between the two families to recompense each for the many offenses they feel they have suffered; they are so grateful they don&rsquo;t notice that you have skimmed nearly a third of the money for yourself. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
