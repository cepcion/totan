<p class="TaleDestiny">(1537) - WISDOM, BRASS TRUMPET  (M)</p>
<p>The other pleasantly agrees to free you if part of the payment is in advance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree, but to your chagrin, the other pockets the advance payment and disappears. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You deduce the other&rsquo;s plan to cheat you, and you refuse the advance. You insist upon your freedom first, and, grumbling, the jailor frees you. True to your word, you pay him. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> The sounding of the Brass Trumpet warns you of the intent of the other to cheat you, and you refuse to give him the bribe. With a shrug, he wanders off, leaving you imprisoned.
[Wisdom]</p>
