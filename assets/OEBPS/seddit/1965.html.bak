<p class="TaleDestiny">(1965) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Many seaside villages have reported sightings and attacks from a large pirate fleet. There are far too many ships in the fleet to attack on your own, so you need to find a powerful prince who can stand up to the pirate captains.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: None of the nobles you visit seem concerned. Secure on land, they do not fear the ravages of the pirates. They may feel different when the warfleet reaches their shores! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You present the plight of the villagers with such eloquence and style that every prince you address promises to aid in the defeat of these rampaging pirates. When you see the size of the fleet sent to destroy the renegades, you have no doubt in the eventual triumph of justice. [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
