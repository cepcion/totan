<p>&ldquo;A spell is a complicated thing,&rdquo; the other says, &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so hard to get test subjects.&rdquo; Before you can respond, the other chants a quick phrase in a harsh language you can&rsquo;t understand.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In a trice, a great jinni appears before you! The other is even more surprised than you. The jinni grabs you and whisks you away to a land beyond men. [D+1 / Move to the <a href="0182.html#TaleHeader">Dusky Land</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
