<p class="TaleDestiny">(2531) - WILDERNESS LORE, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>The other seems flattered by your reaction and invites you to join in a meal beside the campfire. You laugh together, trading stories long into the night, and when you awake the next morning, you find your purse missing. Also missing are your camel, sword, and most of your personal possessions.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stumble to the nearest village, a bedroll all you have to your name. You find charity at a local home, but soon you must continue on. [S+1 / W-4 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Tracking a person through the desert is so much easier when he is burdened with more than he can carry. You catch up to the traitor and ask for your belongings back in exchange for some of the water you have with you. He readily agrees and begs your forgiveness. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Giving chase, you find the thief the next night sitting by a fire, eating your food and reading your personal letters! Come the morrow, though, he finds himself stripped of not only all your goods, but his own meager possessions as well! [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)</p>
