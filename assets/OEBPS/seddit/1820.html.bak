<p class="TaleDestiny">(1820) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A giant serpent has made a home for itself in the heart of a small village, and has taken to feeding on the livestock. It strikes only at night, and the villagers cannot locate it during the day.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You convince a number of the villagers to stand watch all night, so they can see the serpent. Alas! A young boy falls asleep at his post and is that night&rsquo;s victim! You are too distraught to be of any further aid to the villagers. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Judging by the size of the discarded snake skin you find, even if the villagers could locate the serpent, it would be too much for them to handle. Dressing in your most magnificent robes, you approach a nearby fortress. The captain is fooled by your attitude and agrees to dispatch his soldiers as you command. You realize it is best for you to leave the area before he discovers your deception. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
