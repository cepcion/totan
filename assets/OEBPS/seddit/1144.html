<p class="TaleDestiny">(1144) - DETERMINED  (M), ENVIOUS (M), OUTLAW (M)</p>
<p>A hidden trapdoor leads you to a sumptuous apartment where sleeps a beautiful maiden. Gently you awaken her and learn her plight: enslaved by a powerful &rsquo;efreet, she dares not leave. Suddenly, dishes begin to rattle &mdash; &ldquo;Hide!&rdquo; she cries. With a bang, a horrible-looking &rsquo;efreet with a terrible sword appears. &ldquo;I smell the presence of a human,&rdquo; he roars. He advances on the maiden. &ldquo;You have betrayed me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You watch in honor as he slays her with his sword, then vanishes. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS, OUTLAW  (All mandatory)</span>: You cannot sit by while this &rsquo;efreet slays her: she must be yours alone! You leap from hiding and attack the
&rsquo;efreet with your sword.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Magic</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: Your end is brief, but interesting. The &rsquo;efreet eats your sword, then takes hold of your arms and legs and rends you limb from limb until your soul escapes your body and commends itself unto Allah. [Death]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: You slay the &rsquo;efreet, and a thunderclap demolishes the underground palace around you. You are scarcely able to escape with your life, and the maiden and the bounteous treasures all are lost, to your great sorrow. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</li>
</ul>
