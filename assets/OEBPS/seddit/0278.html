<p class="TaleDestiny">(278) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>The other is careful in his business, and you will need help to rob him. You fall in with a shrewd thief who will aid you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: To your sorrow, you discover that the wealthy other has set a thief to catch a thief&mdash;your companion is in his employ. You accommodatingly stumble into the trap. The guards cackle with glee as they throw you in the dungeon. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Your own practice of deception causes you to distrust your companion, and you look into his background. You find that he is in the employ of your intended victim, so you cleverly trick him and make him seem a traitor to his employer. He is imprisoned, while you escape with the gold. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Quick Thinking]</p>
