<p>The captain, Zau al-Makan, has forced all the passengers to give him a portion of their cargo. If you refuse, he will steer the ship onto a reef. You must fight back and take what is yours (and  a little more, for your trouble)! You lead the passengers in mutiny against Zau and his henchmen, slaying them all.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: However, this leaves no one to sail the ship. You are wrecked.
[Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You take over the ship, and under your capable guidance, the voyage is completed. The ship&rsquo;s owner is very grateful. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>] (1 turn)]</p>
