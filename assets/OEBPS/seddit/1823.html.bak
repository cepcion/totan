<p class="TaleDestiny">(1823) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>When the Sultan caught you in the arms of his daughter, he needed a way to punish you both. Being particularly cruel, he forces you to drink from a magical well that has the power to transform man to woman and woman to man!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Expelled from his kingdom and shorn of your identity, you sink to your knees in supplication to the All-Merciful. When you rise, you see a vision of holy Mecca. You determine to make a pilgrimage.
[D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>&mdash;if you are still Sex-Changed when the pilgrimage is complete, lose Sex-Changed]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: On the highway leaving the Sultan&rsquo;s kingdom, you tell your tale to all who will listen. A wise imam hears your tale and is moved to pray on your behalf. Under the holy man&rsquo;s guidance, you make generous gifts to the poor. Afterwards, you are still the wrong gender, but your soul feels much cleansed. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
