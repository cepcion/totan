<p class="TaleDestiny">(2230) - LUCK</p>
<p>The relentless tale of the other&rsquo;s many piteous turns dulls your better judgment.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot take the other&rsquo;s condition as it is and decide that the proper cure is riches. You press your purse on the other and flee. When you cross paths again a few weeks later, nothing has changed: your generous endowment was quickly frittered away. [D+2 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Despite the obvious path of the other&rsquo;s life, you decide to try to relieve his condition. But the other seems not able to change his station in life and has soon spent the whole of your generous offer. Luckily you are able to gamble on a risky local caravan, so you soon recoup most of your losses. [D+2 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
