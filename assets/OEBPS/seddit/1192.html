<p class="TaleDestiny">(1192) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Standing above the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard, you marvel at the heaps of bones and tusks spread out before you. Suddenly, you are grasped from behind! A great bull elephant has rolled you in his trunk and is bearing you off through the forest.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are carried for hours. You become dizzy, disoriented, and lose all sense of direction; finally you lose consciousness. When you awake, you have no idea where you are. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You play dead. After you have been limp and motionless for a while, the elephant drops you and moves off silently into the forest. Fortunately you have been able to maintain your sense of direction, and return quickly to civilization. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
