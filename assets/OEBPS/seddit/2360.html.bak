<p class="TaleDestiny">(2360) - PIETY</p>
<p>You have been treated poorly in the past by those who practice the Arts, and though the other has a good reputation, you nevertheless find yourself driven to violence.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your blows reduce the other to a bloody mess. You stare at your weapon with awe&mdash;truly, steel is mightier than magic! But when you look back toward your victim, there is nothing there save a small scrap of parchment. When you pick it up, it disappears in a flash. You shrug and continue on your way, stumbling every few steps, though you know not why. [<span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Before you do something regrettable, your faith calms your breast. It matters not what methods are used to spread kindness and gentility to others, but those that do so should be honored, not hated. You bring yourself to smile in appreciation of the other&rsquo;s deeds before you head on your way. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
