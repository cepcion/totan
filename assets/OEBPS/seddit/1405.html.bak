<p class="TaleDestiny">(1405) - PIETY</p>
<p>As you pray, a jinni arises from the water, asking your business here.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You say that you are paying honor to the greatest of Prophets (save only Mohammed), and he is most pleased by your response. You converse about the time of Solomon and learn many interesting things.
[D+2 / S+2 / Scholarship / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You praise Solomon, and compare him to Mohammed (a thousand blessings on his name). The jinni professes ignorance of Islam, and you educate him. He surrenders to the Faith immediately, and grants you a tremendous gift for your favor. [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Fabulous) / Magic]</p>
