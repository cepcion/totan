<p class="TaleDestiny">(1675) - SCHOLARSHIP, MAGIC</p>
<p>In a strange corner of a strange town, you are amazed to discover one dressed in princely robes standing by a well. By his fire-red skin and clawed hands, you can plainly tell that he is not mortal, but one of the jinn! Seeing kindness in your face, he confesses to you that he has lost his memories of who and what and where he is. Can you assist him?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You tell the other that he is clearly a jinni and that his kingdom is far away. Perhaps, you suggest, he could find a wizard who could guide him further. The other thanks you with a small gift. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, MAGIC</span>: You waste no time but immediately begin to tell the jinni all you know of the people of the smokeless fire. With each sentence, you can see recognition pass before the other&rsquo;s eyes until, finally, with a roar of delight, the jinni bursts into a spear of fire and ascends into the sky. You see now the way to follow to his homeland. [D+1 / S+1 / Magic / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0182.html#TaleHeader">Dusky Land</a>]</p>
