<p class="TaleDestiny">(2021) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You hear screams of fear. Moving toward the sound, you see a powerful flesh-eating ogress has cornered a young woman. She pleads for mercy, but the gooleh grimly attacks and devours her. Paralyzed with fear, you can do nothing but watch this horrid sight. Curiously, the gooleh appears dejected by her deeds. She drops to her knees and calls out in a guttural voice, &ldquo;Allah, I do as is commanded by my nature. If you are displeased with my actions, I ask that you smite me down.&rdquo; She waits for a few moments, but nothing happens. She moves off consumed by her thoughts. You follow, vowing to exact Allah&rsquo;s retribution.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After a short while, the monster notices you. Disgusted with your hesitancy before, you stride forward, claiming Allah guides your actions. She scorns your mission, beats you soundly, and torments you for days before leaving you to die. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You flit like a shadow after the beast, silent as the grave. After several hours, she drops to the ground and quickly falls into a deep sleep. You stealthily approach and slit her throat with your dagger. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
