<p class="TaleDestiny">(1796) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You sneak into the strange pavilion, curious about what you might find. You discover a disturbing collection of torture devices. You turn to leave&mdash;and run directly into the legs of a great black giant! The giant takes great delight in testing his newest devices on you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Eventually, he grows bored by your screams and curses and casts you aside. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: He has never encountered a subject as resilient and disciplined as you! He decides that his machines are defective, and smashes them in his fury. While he is thus distracted, you kick over the brazier filled with hot coals, setting the pavilion aflame and enabling your escape. But the giant&rsquo;s size works against him and he spends the last moments of his life entangled in the burning canvas of his tent! [D+2 / S+1]</p>
