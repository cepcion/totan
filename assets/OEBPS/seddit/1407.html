<p class="TaleDestiny">(1407) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>It is said that the names on the seal grant all nature of remarkable powers to those who understand them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When later you study the names you have transcribed, though, you realize that you are not one who can. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The names are most antique and wondrous, and you contemplate their meaning for many weeks before you understand them. With that understanding, though, worlds of possibility are opened to you. [D+2 / S+2 / Magic / Wisdom]</p>
