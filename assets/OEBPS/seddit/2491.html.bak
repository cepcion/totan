<p class="TaleDestiny">(2491) - PIETY</p>
<p>While enjoying the library of a local scholar, you hear frustrated and loud sighs. Unable to concentrate with this distraction, you confront the rude person. The other stands before you, holding a clutch of scrolls and looking confused. You demand to know what is wrong and the other tells you of his desire to become a greater scholar, and also of his lack of ideas of how to begin or what to study.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You admonish the youth, explaining that not all wisdom comes from books. The other sets off to explore the world. You hear later that the journey was not a successful one. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You scold the youth; there is one great path that precedes all other knowledge of the universe. You take the scrolls from his hands and guide him to a copy of the Koran. The other blesses you and begins to study. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
