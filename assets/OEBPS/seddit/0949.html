<p class="TaleDestiny">(949) - APPEARANCE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, INSANE  (M)</p>
<p>You see the other, a known criminal, tied to a tree&mdash;his captor nowhere to be seen. The other is about to get free of his bonds. Your only recourse is to attack! You cut at him but hit the tree instead. A low moan arises from&hellip; somewhere. Suddenly a huge &rsquo;efreet stands before you. &ldquo;How dare you harm my home!&rdquo; he cries.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You tell the &rsquo;efreet that you merely sought to obtain the necklace. The &rsquo;efreet guffaws, then turns your axe into a pile of wood. Then&hellip; you feel yourself change. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: The &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s anger is softened by your pleasing words and countenance. [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory):</span> You leap at the &rsquo;efreet with a cry, brandishing your axe. With ringing strokes you assail your foe, but succeed only in blunting the axe against his inhuman skin. Clucking in annoyance, the &rsquo;efreet flicks the weapon from your grip, and, taking you up in his palm-frond-sized hands, makes a hole in your body and frees your soul.
