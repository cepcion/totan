<p class="TaleDestiny">(2475) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Some creatures are simply too horrific to face alone. Having found one such beast, you know that you must find other people to aid you against it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Lesser men abound and cannot be made to stand against their fear for any price. You learn that this is the only kind of men who make their homes in this town. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Though you may not inspire bravery in the cowardly townsfolk, you do know the words that will motivate the captain of the guard. You soon find yourself beside him at the front of the column, confidently following the trail of the monster. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
