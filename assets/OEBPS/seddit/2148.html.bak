<p>There is so much treasure here that you could not possibly carry it on your own. So you use some of that money to buy camels to carry the hoard back home. On the way to the treasure, you are attacked by brigands, who steal all your camels. Taking some more of that money, you buy more camels; but these are eaten by an angry &rsquo;efreet. You grab some more money and buy another pack of camels, which are promptly carried away by a pair of rocs. Frustrated, you content yourself with what you can carry on your person.
