<p class="TaleDestiny">(1709) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You see sunlight reflecting off of something in the water, and you decide to investigate. Lowering a dinghy, your sailors row you towards the glimmering object. When you get closer, you realize it is an enormous fish: a dendan!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The sailors panic at the sight of the great beast and immediately turn the dinghy about to return to the ship. Despite your best efforts, you cannot arrest their fear. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Seeing the fear in the sailors&rsquo; eyes, you know they are about to panic. But you remember the tales of great sailors who have faced these beasts before. You describe to them the weakness of the dendan, and how the simple voice of a human is enough to kill them. Reassured, they allow you to investigate the beautiful creature more closely. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
