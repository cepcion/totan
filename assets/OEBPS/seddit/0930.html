<p class="TaleDestiny">(930) - WILDERNESS LORE, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>It is twilight. Through the forest you see a great ghostly form moving silently and sinuously toward you, eyes glittering in the faint light.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You await its approach, intoning your prayers. The beast&mdash;a great white tiger&mdash;approaches you curiously, batters you with his great paws like a cat with a field mouse, and then wanders silently off into the dark forest. [D+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You silently inch downwind so that it will not catch your scent, and the great white tiger does not notice you. Later, when your fear is gone, you marvel at its great beauty, and are moved to praise Allah&rsquo;s power and subtlety as evidenced in such a magnificent beast. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
