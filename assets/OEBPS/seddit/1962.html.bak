<p class="TaleDestiny">(1962) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You approach a large fleet of ships. Your vessel is surrounded and boarded. The admiral of the fleet demands that you join them in their raid on an enemy city.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You see no alternative but to join the fleet. Three days later, a massive storm strikes, and the fleet is scattered. Breathing a prayer of thanks to almighty Allah for his aid, you sail away before the fleet can regroup. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You impress the admiral with your knowledge and understanding of warfare. For many long hours, he listens as you describe methods and tactics for the attack. He follows your advice.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;3: The defenders are too strong. Even with your input, the invasion is repulsed. [D-1 / S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4+: Your strategy makes the difference between victory and defeat. The Admiral is pleased and gives you the first choice of the plunder. [D+1 / Treasure]</li>
