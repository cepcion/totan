<p class="TaleDestiny">(1866) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>How dare that odorous wretch attempt to use hypnotic powers on you! You will teach him a lesson he&rsquo;ll never forget!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Once you start the beating, many victims of the other come to join you. It seems he has been misusing his powers for some time!
[D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: As you rain blows down on the other, you suddenly realize that his powers could be very useful. Staying your hand, you apologize for your anger and convince him to help you relieve some of the locals of their heavy purses. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling]</p>
