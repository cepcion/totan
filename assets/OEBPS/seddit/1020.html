<p class="TaleDestiny">(1020) - BEAST FORM  (M),  APPEARANCE, BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>As you are going about your business, a powerful Vizier comes upon you. You struggle to free yourself as he embraces you, crying, &ldquo;You are dearer to me than my brother.&rdquo; He drapes his robe around your shoulders, ties his turban around your head, and bids you farewell. Confused, you watch him depart. Suddenly, men surround you crying, &ldquo;Here is the Vizier!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They beat you mercilessly. Meanwhile, the wicked one escapes. You will not allow such to cozen up to you so easily in the future! [D+1 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">BEAST FORM  (mandatory),  APPEARANCE</span>: When they see your face, they realize you are not the Vizier. You describe the clothes the Vizier was wearing and make easy his capture, but you find it best to be far away away before he returns. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>] (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You explain what has occurred, and they listen to your words; you produce the Brass Trumpet, and with its magic you find the Vizier where he hides. He is punished, and you are well rewarded for your virtue. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Courtly Graces]</p>
