<p class="TaleDestiny">(887) - SPARKLING SPEAR  (M), WISDOM</p>
<p>From a short distance away, you hear an uncanny voice crying, &ldquo;Free me! Free me!&rdquo; Hurrying forward, you come across a shadowy jinni hovering over a slain body.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, SPARKLING SPEAR  (mandatory):</span> The &rsquo;efreet must have killed this man! In a rage, you draw your sword, and with but a blow, you easily slay it&mdash;to your great surprise. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Something in the manner of the jinni makes you pause. Seeing you, the &rsquo;efreet at once exclaims, &ldquo;By the will of Allah, free me! This man was a fearsome weaver of enchantments, brought down by his own evil! Take the ring from his finger and destroy it, that I might return to my own lands!&rdquo; Clearly, this jinni is of the Believing Djinn, and you do as he asks. When the ring is destroyed, he showers you with gratitude, for the joys of the People of the Flame are as great as their wrath. He offers to take you with him as he returns to his home in the Dusky Land. [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0182.html#TaleHeader">Dusky Land</a>]</p>
