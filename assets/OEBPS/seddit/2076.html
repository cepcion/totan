<p class="TaleDestiny">(2076) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>The captain beat you soundly at dice, taking all of your money in the process, but you are convinced that he cheated in order to do it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to follow the captain away from the tavern in the hopes of catching him alone and getting your money back, but he spots you along the way and sends three of his men to teach you a lesson.
[S+1 / W=Beggar / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Once out of the vicinity, you take up position across from the tavern and wait for the captain to stagger out. You follow along the rooftops, shadowing his progress on the street. Before he reaches his ship, he stops to relieve himself against a wall, and that&rsquo;s when you strike, taking all your money back&mdash;and then some! [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
