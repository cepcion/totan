<p class="TaleDestiny">(1822) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You have been put under a most terrible spell! Tricked by your cunning guide to drink from the mysterious spring, you have found your gender reversed. Now he intends to sell you into slavery!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your prayers for deliverance are answered, but in a form far from what you had hoped. A magician tells you that when your body is rebuilt after leaving this plane, it will return to its true form. Not realizing what he means by a plane, you accept his offer without thinking. Now you are in the strange and frightening land of the jinn!
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: Despite your prayers for aid from the divine, you are auctioned off for a fine price. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
