<p>On the way to a distant city you encounter an old man walking on the road. His gait is slow and his back bent from the heavy burden he carries. As you are headed in the same direction, you offer assistance. He is surprised.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You offer to take the old man&rsquo;s burden and strap it to your horse. &ldquo;Why would you do that for me?&rdquo; asks the man. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; you reply, &ldquo;it is the right thing to do.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You offer to trade places with the old man, so that he rides atop the horse and you walk. &ldquo;Why would you do that for me?&rdquo; asks the man. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; you reply, &ldquo;it is the right thing to do&hellip; and the wise way to do it.&rdquo; [D+2 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
