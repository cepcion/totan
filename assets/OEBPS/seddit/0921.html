<p class="TaleDestiny">(921) - WILDERNESS LORE, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>Off the road, you see a mule mired in a mud hole. The poor beast is exhausted, and there is no sign of its master.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot reach it without becoming trapped yourself, and you leave rather than witness its death. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You cover the surface of the mud with your cloak and stretch out&hellip; you can just reach its bridle. Speaking soft encouragement, you patiently coax the mule from the mud. Never will you have a more faithful and grateful beast. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p></p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You throw the Golden Bridle to the mule, and it miraculously wraps itself around the mule&rsquo;s head! With the bridle in place, you can easily lead the mule to safety. Never will you have a more faithful and grateful beast. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
