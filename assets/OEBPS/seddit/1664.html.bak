<p class="TaleDestiny">(1664) - PIETY, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>After many days lost in the wilderness, you are sorely relieved to come to a small town built around a lovely and ever-flowing spring. The people, however, are rude to the point of insult and fear haunts their every step. Comes the time for the noon prayer and you turn to the spire of the mosque, only to discover the cause of the townspeopleâ€˜s terror: a stream of fire arises from the tower and resolves into a vile demon! Seeing you, the evil one laughs and shouts, &ldquo;Ah! Another one who still pays worship to the so-called God of Gods! Become my servant! Bow before me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Quaking before the power of the evil one, you feel all choice leaving you. You offer your life and soul to the monster to do with as it will. [Lose Piety / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You fling out your left hand in contempt to the tempter. Raising your eyes to the sky, you cry out the Shahada and the Sura Al-Fatiha as proof of your faith and never do you quaver. The marid recoils as if stung by lightning, and says, &ldquo;None before you has ever stood true to his creed! Truly, you have shown me that the Most High can conquer even the fear of death. I shower you with thanks for this lesson!&rdquo; So saying, the monster frees the town from its spell and departs to contemplate your deeds. The townspeople in turn shower you with thanks for your assistance in freeing them from this monster. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
