<p class="TaleDestiny">(2011) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are sneaking around the site of a recent battle in a small town between two mighty kingdoms, looking for loot, when you hear a horrid keening from a decrepit building nearby. Moving closer, you see a gooleh and her three children consuming the remains of what appears to be a soldier. The tears in their eyes do not seem to slack their appetites. You circle the house, looking for the guardsman&rsquo;s weapons. You find a heavy spear, on it impaled yet another gool child.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Revolted by this situation, you grab the spear and rush to the nearest army tent. The guards dispatch the beast and her spawn, claiming all the credit for themselves. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You prop the dead creature up on the weapon and push it through a crumbled wall. With a guttural wail, you accuse the family of dishonoring &ldquo;your&rdquo; memory. Ashamed, the monsters flee.
