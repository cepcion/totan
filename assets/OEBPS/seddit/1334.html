<p class="TaleDestiny">(1334) - STORYTELLING, COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You gaze in rapture at the jewel-encrusted battlements, then at the dusty and crumbled walls. As you look upon the mighty handiwork of man, laid low by Allah, you resolve to capture this moment in a poem.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot find the proper words, curse your miserable life. Others make mock of your verse. [D+2 / S+1 / Storytelling / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your poem is so wise and sad that the Sultan of this land  adopts you as his own child. He re-reads the poem so many times that he dies of a broken heart, and you are made Sultan. [D+3 / S+3 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
