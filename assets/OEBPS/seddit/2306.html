<p class="TaleDestiny">(2306) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Listening to the other you find him quite wise&hellip; until you realize that he is planning a grand swindle for which you will be blamed! You take no time for questions&mdash;you attack!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other is surprisingly agile and almost bests you. But your experience allows you to get the upper hand at the last moment and toss the other into the nearby river. You declare what you have done to all who gather to watch the struggle, and at your words they suggest that you keep the other&rsquo;s possessions. [S+1 / Treasure]</p>
