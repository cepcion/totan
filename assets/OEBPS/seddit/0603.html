<p class="TaleDestiny">(603) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You purchase the slave and all goes well for several weeks, despite persistent rumors which reach your ears of the slave&rsquo;s indiscretions. One day an outraged citizen appears at your door and demands that the slave be turned over for punishment for his crimes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The evidence is incontrovertible. You must turn your slave over for punishment. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You have anticipated this moment, and have concocted an alibi both clever and well-told, which will definitely prove your slaveâ€˜s innocence. The outraged citizen is convinced, and leaves mollified. You chastise your slave but are glad to retain him. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
