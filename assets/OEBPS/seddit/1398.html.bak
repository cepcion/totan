<p class="TaleDestiny">(1398) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>At one undersea palace you are made an honored guest, and you dwell there for many a week. One day, you chance upon the eldest child of the Sultan, who weeps bitter tears. You inquire as to the nature of his sorrow. The cause, he reveals, is none other than love, for he has beheld a land-dweller who has captured his heart.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give him what words of consolation you can, but nothing you say betters his situation. Sorrow fills your heart in sympathy for him, but is dispelled by thoughts of your spouse and the joys that love has brought you. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You teach him all the secret ways of the arts of love, and delight him with tales of your own marriage and the joys it has brought. Emboldened by your teaching, he boldly courts the one who has captured his heart, and soon they are wed. You are celebrated throughout the Land beneath the Sea for making this possible. [D+3 / S+3 / Robe of Honor]</p>
