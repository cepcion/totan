<p class="TaleDestiny">(1613) - PIETY  (M)</p>
<p>The other tells you of his many trials as you travel. You listen and are astounded by the depths of his wantonness.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You send him off to undertake the Hadj to Mecca as forgiveness, never expecting him to return. To your great surprise, he tracks you down after his pilgrimage and becomes your devoted vassal, praising you with every step. [D+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> You decide that the other must make undertake the Hadj to Mecca, and that you must do the same. You travel together doing good works in the name of Allah. [D+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>]</p>
