<p class="TaleDestiny">(201) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You try to get the other&rsquo;s attention to discuss a matter of some financial importance, but he seems distracted and rudely ignores your actions.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You take umbrage at this rudeness, and stalk off in a huff. Only later do you realize that you have wasted an opportunity at great riches. [<span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You politely apologize for wasting the other&rsquo;s time and make ready to go on your way. At your kind words, the other snaps out of his reverie, and apologizes in turn. The other then proceeds to tell you his tale of woe, misery, and destitution. Your commiserations lighten his load, and in gratitude for your kindness, he journeys with you for many a day. [S+2 /<span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]
