<p class="TaleDestiny">(2479) - LUCK</p>
<p>The terrible flood has finally ended, and the land is a washed out plain of mud and mire. You begin looking for survivors when you hear a mournful whimpering from beneath an overturned wagon. You dig beneath it to discover a half-starved and half-drowned hunting hound. You share the last of your food with the ragged animal, hoping that it won&rsquo;t take too long to find help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With the dog to help you, you soon find some waterlogged food supplies. It takes a few days, but you finally leave the flooded plain behind and continue on your journey. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: As you and your new companion wander the water-blasted landscape, you are surprised to see a column of horsemen approaching you. At the head rides none other than the Sultan himself! He is delighted to see you, but even more delighted to see the dog. For rescuing his most prized hound, he awards you with the highest of honors. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
