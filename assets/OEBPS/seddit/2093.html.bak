<p class="TaleDestiny">(2093) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You have been found out! You were taking liberties with the captain&rsquo;s oldest child, and the captain finally found out about it. Both you and your paramour are summoned to his presence. &ldquo;I have many enemies who will take advantage of any dishonor on my reputation I will not stand by as my family honor is besmirched,&rdquo; the captain spits.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;You must either leave at once, never to return, or fight me for the wrong you have done my family.&rdquo; Wanting only to honor the man, you agree to take your leave. When you return home, however, you find the captain&rsquo;s eldest waiting there for you. He ran away just to be with you, and verily is his father right wroth! [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You apologize profusely, and before he can respond, you offer to make it right. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he demands to know &ldquo;Simple,&rdquo; you reply. &ldquo;I shall make an honest couple of us.&rdquo; He is still upset, but one look into his child&rsquo;s hopeful eyes melts his cold heart, and he consents. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</p>
