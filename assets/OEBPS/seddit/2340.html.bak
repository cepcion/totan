<p class="TaleDestiny">(2340) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>Your ship has been destroyed by a dendan! You hold on to some floating jetsam as the water froths about you. You try to shout, but water keeps entering your mouth. Suddenly, a merman appears next to you and bids you to follow him underwater.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your situation compels you to follow, even though you don&rsquo;t know how you will survive. The merman puts some strange oil on you and pushes you underwater. You&rsquo;re scared at first but then you realize you can move and breathe underwater as if on land. With renewed confidence, you follow the merman to his abode, where you are treated like family. After a few days of generous hospitality, the merman brings you back to the dry land&hellip; along with some gifts. [D+2 / S+2 / Luck / Dendan Oil]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You are grateful for the assistance, but you explain that your skills lie on the surface of the water, not underneath. You ask to be taken to dry land to await a proper rescue. [S+1]</p>
