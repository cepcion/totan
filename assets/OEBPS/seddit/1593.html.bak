<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is of no use: the other is just too powerful. But an opportunity arises and you make your escape, with the bellows of your enemy following you. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / Have another player place you in any non-city, non-sea space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You fight for hours, but finally you prevail and your opponent is slain!
