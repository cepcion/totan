<p class="TaleDestiny">(374) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Your victim seems to be far away, and you glimpse treasure and strange artifacts among his possessions. However, the other comes upon you in the act.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your feeble explanation of your presence is transparent. You are brought before the Sultan, whose justice is harsh but fair&mdash;a whipping and imprisonment. You burn at the thought of the treasure you might have had. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You improvise a marvelous story describing how you found a brass jar in a cave, just like the one in the other&rsquo;s treasure trove. When you picked it up and rubbed it, a great &rsquo;efreet appeared and cast a powerful spell, and you found yourself here in the other&rsquo;s chambers. Accustomed to such marvels, the other believes you and lets you go.
