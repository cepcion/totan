<p class="TaleDestiny">(801) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Your attack takes the other by surprise, but his strenuous acts of devotion and purity of faith have made him strong and determined. He defends himself very effectively.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize his strength too late and cannot disengage. He batters you unconscious and walks away in contempt. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You have a sudden idea and you begin to whirl in place and chant clumsily. The dervish is taken in by your pretense and is fooled into thinking that what he thought was an attack was actually a peculiar and vigorous devotional ritual. Politer (but warily), he permits you to go on your way. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
