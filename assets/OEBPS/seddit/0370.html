<p class="TaleDestiny">(370) - STORYTELLING, ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You accost the other, but he simply says, &ldquo;Take what you wish. I have no use for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Indeed, in examining the possessions, you can see why the other has no use for them. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You are struck by the despondent air of the other, and choose not to plunder his meager goods. Instead you tell him a story which cheers his heart. In gratitude he teaches you a few enchantments. [D+1]</p>
