<p class="TaleDestiny">(2032) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>A beguiling merchant sells you a map to a secret treasure cache. You find the location deep in a cave, but the way is barred by a trapdoor made of a mysterious metal and topped by a large gem. You attempt to raise the door, but nothing you try succeeds. Frustrated, you pry the gem from the door in an attempt to salvage something from the trip.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The gem turns out to be cut glass, worth only a few coins. The money you paid for the map is utterly lost. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You have the gem appraised and it turns out to be worth little. Still, it is impressive-looking and it inspires you. In each village that you visit for the next month, you spin a more and more elaborate tale about what that trapdoor hid, and what the gem meant. At the culmination of the story, you display the remarkable bauble to great applause. [D+1 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
