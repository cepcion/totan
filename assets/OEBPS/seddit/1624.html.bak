<p class="TaleDestiny">(1624) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>Only one being stands between you and the artifact of your desire. You quickly assess the other&rsquo;s skills and decide to rob him by trickery instead of main force, and you engage him in conversation.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other talks incessantly; you will be driven mad if you stay any longer. You forget the artifact and rudely excuse yourself. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You are able to get in an occasional word among the other&rsquo;s babbling, and your tales of your adventures eventually draw his full attention. You keep him enthralled long enough to secret the artifact on your person. With this accomplished, you apologize profusely for having to leave to a prior engagement. [D+2 / S+1 / Seal Ring]</p>
