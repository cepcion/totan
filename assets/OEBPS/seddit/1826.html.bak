<p class="TaleDestiny">(1826) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The black magician stands on the small island in the middle of the shallow lake, his smug look setting your blood aboil. His unspeakable acts have earned the ire of the Sultan, and you intend to collect the reward. You order your men to attack, but when the first of them reaches the water, they all fall back in confusion. Those who merely touched the water of the accursed spring have been transformed into women!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The soldiers will not stand before such vile sorcery. They refuse to attack, and quickly begin to desert. The evil magician laughs scornfully as you are forced to retreat. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: If touching the water is the cause of the curse, then surely a boat will protect you from the dark magic. You seize a local fisherman&rsquo;s dinghy and cast off. When the magician realizes that you have seen through his ploy, he speaks some words that should not be understood, and vanishes from the island. Though you did not slay the sorcerer, the Sultan is pleased that you have chased him off and gives you half the reward. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
