<p class="TaleDestiny">(2087) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other, it is said, is a great captain, but when you observe him, he is a bundle of superstitions and terrors. He double- and triple-checks ropes, taps every barrel with a hammer, and is in all ways a very portrait of uncertainty and upset. Perhaps you should find another ship to sail on?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the other notices you moving on, he laughs a nervous, bitter laugh and calls out to you. &ldquo;The sea claims its costs from all who venture on it. I pay by my caution. You cannot fail to pay just by choosing another ship!&rdquo; [<span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: The other might be superstitious, but you can see that there is much sense in the things he does. You carefully note his practices and encourage those on your ship to take heed. [D+1 / Seamanship]</p>
