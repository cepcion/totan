<p class="TaleDestiny">(2353) - None</p>
<p>The slave market is busy, buzzing with sounds of selling and buying. Then a new slave, hooded, appears, ready to be auctioned. Everything goes silent&mdash;no noise whatsoever is heard. You look around at all the entranced faces, then catch the eyes of the slave. A will not your own compels you to shout &ldquo;One gold coin!&rdquo; &ldquo;Sold!&rdquo; &mdash; and with that, sound returns to the marketplace. Suddenly the slave appears besides you, revealing himself to be a wizard. He tells you he was cursed to be sold into slavery. Luckily, he perceived you as having a kind soul and had enough power left to him to choose you over the others to buy him. He returns your gold coin&mdash;and a small purse full of more like it&mdash;as a reward, then bids you farewell. [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
