<p class="TaleDestiny">(1931) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>In need of an assistant, you seek to employ someone worthy. Your search brings you to the other, who upon seeing you, points and begins to speak gibberish.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are frightened by the undecipherable words of the other, and worry that it may turn the townsfolk against you. You make a hasty retreat. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize the signs of an enchantment upon the other. Quickly and carefully, you lead the other to a sacred dervish, who agrees to aid him. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
