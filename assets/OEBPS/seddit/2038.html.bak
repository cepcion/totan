<p class="TaleDestiny">(2038) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A secret admirer sends you a package. It is an ivory mask, trimmed in silver. This is a valuable gift indeed! Determined to find your benefactor, you don the mask and attend the next day&rsquo;s masquerade celebration. You pass a pleasant several hours in conversation and revelry until a servant approaches and asks you to join the one who gave you the mask in an antechamber. Pleased by your cleverness, you follow. Unfortunately, your admirer turns out to staggeringly ugly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You flee in horror and disappointment. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: As you donned your mask, you adopted a different voice and set of mannerisms. You claim that you bought the mask from an adventurer who needed money for his travels. The other is saddened at what he believes is a mistaken identity and bids you good night.
