<p>Your attack is turned aside, and you are defeated by the other. With a cruel laugh, he reveals himself to be a fire-worshipping Magian! He binds you in ropes and carries you to the lip of a volcano, which is rumbling as though about to erupt.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In you go&mdash;but at that very moment the volcano erupts, belching forth a blast of gas that bears you far away. Miraculously, you are only injured by your landing and not killed outright, although your belongings are scattered across the face of the world and you are left without means to travel. [D+4 / S+2 / W-3 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Lose all Treasures]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: &ldquo;There is no strength or power but in Allah,&rdquo; you cry, and at that moment the volcano erupts. A flow of lava burns your enemy to a crisp, but through the Mercy of the Most Holy God, you are spared. When the eruption is over, you see that you stand at the lip of a strangely glistening valley. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> / Move to the <a href="0180.html#TaleHeader">Valley of Diamonds</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
