    <p class="TaleName">THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS</p>
    <p>You know this place from tales of great antiquity. This valley is known to contain two things: huge diamonds of incalculable value and tiny serpents of incredible deadliness. To get the diamonds, merchants throw animal carcasses into the valley; at sunup, giant rocs carry the carcasses back up the mountainside to eat. The merchants then frighten the rocs away and remove the diamonds stuck in the meat. There are legends of brave men who have walked the valley and lived, but you fear they are only legends. </p>
    <p>You have come through secret ways to the lower portion of the valley, where your heart leaps at the sight of the giant diamonds and quails at the sight of the deadly serpents. </p>
    <p>You may&hellip;</p>
    <p><span class="choice">Choice 1:</span> Sneak past the serpents, collect as many diamonds as possible, and sneak back the way you came.</p>
    <p><span class="choice">Choice 2:</span> Grab whatever diamonds you can, then wait for an animal carcass to fall. Hide in the body until a roc brings you out and a merchant rescues you.</p>
    <p><span class="choice">Choice 3:</span> Slay all the serpents that live in the valley, making it safe for men to walk. Perhaps Allah will grant you success in this.</p>
    <p>Which do you choose?</p>
