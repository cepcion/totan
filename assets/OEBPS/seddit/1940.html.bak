<p>You have learned of a certain someone who has fallen prey to a vile spirit. You resolve to help him. To earn the trust of the possessing force, you pretend to hire the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Despite your best efforts, you cannot trick the spirit to free the unfortunate other. Laughing evilly, the spirit forces the other to kill himself before your very eyes! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You know that many such spirits cannot abide running water. It takes some trickery, but you are able to get the other aboard a boat and out onto the water. Unable to escape the vessel, the spirit rampages around the boat before finally releasing the other and disappearing into the night. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
