<p class="TaleDestiny">(618) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You hear strange noises in the twilight gloom. Something is coming!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hide and see dark forms approaching. One of them catches your scent on the air, and they all flee. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You know to hide downwind of the creatures that they might not catch your scent. You watch in amazement as strange, dark creatures gather and caper in the moonlight, amidst a sound like crystal spheres jostled in the wind. Truly the spectacle is most remarkable, and you study them closely. You know that the Caliph in Baghdad is one who collects tales of strange beasts, and could you but tell him of this, you would be richly rewarded! [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Place your Destination marker in Baghdad; when you arrive there, draw a random Treasure]</p>
