<p class="TaleDestiny">(1220) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>In your travels, you have met with a foul fate! You and your companions are captured by a grotesque giant. Each day he impales, cooks, and eats one of your party. You rig together some weapons from sticks and stones and exhort those around you to attack the giant.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The attack fails miserably&mdash;three of you are killed outright before the giant herds you into separate cages. You spend days trembling in terror. Finally, you are the only one left. The next day the giant does not return. After two more hungry days, you finally escape, gibbering into the night. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The giant is fearsome, but you are many. Though many are slain, by your skill you lead the captives to triumph. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span> ]</p>
