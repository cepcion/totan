<p class="TaleDestiny">(1851) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other has salvaged many fine goods from shipwrecks and is looking for a business partner to help him sell the goods among the surface people. The other is certainly cunning, but you feel as though your skills could make the other&rsquo;s endeavors that much more successful. You agree to an alliance with him. The other gives you a few crates of fine pottery to sell.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do sell the fine pottery very quickly. However, the other berates you for not getting a higher price, and does no further business with you. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: A distinctive pattern on the plates and lamps leads you to investigate their origin. You soon come to realize that the merman has, himself, caused many of the wrecks he has &ldquo;salvaged.&rdquo; You arrange for the other to come to the surface on the pretense of making a large sale, but when he arrives, he is greeted by a veritable army of the merchants he has robbed. The merchants reward you handsomely for your honesty. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
