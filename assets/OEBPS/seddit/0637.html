<p class="TaleDestiny">(637) - None</p>
<p>While you are praying, there appears before you a man in strange garb, his face concealed in the folds of his robe. He says, in a voice that chills your blood in your veins, &ldquo;At the source of this river is a marvelous edifice. Give me a gift and I will lead you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">If you have a treasure or your wealth is Penniless or greater, you may give him a gift or refuse:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not or cannot give him a gift</span>: He hisses at you and vanishes before your eyes! [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you give him a gift, roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Beguiling</span> and one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Seduction</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Appearance</span> (if you are female)</span>:</li>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: He accepts your gift, laughs hollowly, and vanishes before your eyes! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> / Choice of Lose one Treasure or W-1 (Min: Beggar)]</li>
