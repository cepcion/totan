<p class="TaleDestiny">(296) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>As you draw closer, you come to believe that the other is not who you had first thought. The other&rsquo;s features flow like water, his perfect beauty uncanny and unnatural. You are inflamed with passion by this beautiful one, and find yourself irresistibly drawn to make amorous advances, even overstepping the bounds of decency.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other recoils in horror, exclaiming, &ldquo;Get away, foul worm! Oh, why must I be cursed this way?&rdquo; These cruel words break the spell that drew you, tearing at your heart and fill it with sorrow. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other is smitten with your charms, and you spend together a night of unimaginable rapture. When you awake, the other has mysteriously disappeared, and none can tell the manner of his going. Memory of his scent and touch fill your mind, driving you to distraction. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
