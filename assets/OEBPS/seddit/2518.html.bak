<p class="TaleDestiny">(2518) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are bowed in evening prayer when a shadow passes over you. A figure stands over you, sandals worn, robes torn and stained. He tells you that the place is cursed and that you risk grave harm by remaining. He offers to lend you a charm that will protect you while you pray, but he is desperately hungry and needs food. Unsure of the wretch&rsquo;s claims, you offer only a crust of bread. He demands more.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You refuse and send him away. Still, you are shaken. You rush through your prayers and depart as quickly as possible. As the night wears on, you grow restless, feeling as if you have neglected your duty. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You look at the man in righteous indignation. &ldquo;A man must show proper respect to Allah, and aid in such an endeavor should not be withheld,&rdquo; you caution. You demand that the old man bow down and pray with you, so you both may benefit from the charm&rsquo;s effect. Intimidated, he takes the bread you offer and complies. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
