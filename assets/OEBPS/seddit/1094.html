<p class="TaleDestiny">(1094) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>While helping a poor farmer dig his fields, you come across a small chest. Opening it, you discover silver coins.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may keep it yourself or tell the farmer of your discovery:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you share your discovery</span>: You piously give the money to the farmer.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He is delighted and thanks you, but does not offer to share. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: As he counts the silver, you tell the tale of a man who did not share bread with his family. The others were given food later, never shared with him, and he starved. The farmer takes your meaning and gives you half the silver. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</li>
