<p>&ldquo;Get away from me, you worm!&rdquo; whispers the other. &ldquo;You have no call to question me! Get away, or be thrashed!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other stalks off indignantly. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Stung by his harsh words, you play the toady, persuading the other to boast of his wrong-doing, you take his confession to interested parties, who reward you for the information. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
