<p class="TaleDestiny">(1956) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>It takes you a few minutes to realize what you have found. It is nothing less than the fabled Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard! You are about to rejoice for your luck when you realize that you are not alone. One of the sons of the Sultan is making his way through the bones. You approach him, and discover that he is leading an expedition in the jungle and is trying to decide the best way to transport a portion of this magnificent ivory back to the palace.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You offer to assist the young prince as another bearer, and he gladly accepts. For many days, you and the others carry heavy ivory tusks through the jungle. When you arrive, the prince pays you a small reward for your kindness. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You describe to the prince tales you have heard of local tribes transporting enormous quantities of goods through the jungle along their secret paths. Acting on your advice, he hires some local guides to ease the journey back to the palace. The Sultan is impressed when he hears the prince describe your assistance; he decides that you could be a trustworthy advisor. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
