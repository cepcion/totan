<p class="TaleDestiny">(1821) - LUCK</p>
<p>You broke your lover&rsquo;s heart, but what is that to you? You got what you wanted. Maybe you should have been suspicious when the servant gave you a gift from the jilted soul. But the water was clean and clear and just a little sweet. When the odd sensations fade, you realize that you are transformed!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are so mistreated by members of your former sex trying to coerce favors from you, you are reduced to tears. You vow before Allah that you will never again seduce another! [S+1 / Lose Seduction / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: In total despair, you are about to take your own life. A passing dervish interrupts your preparations. You tell him your sorry tale, and he agrees to pray with you for the mercy of the Most High. The next morning, you are returned to your normal form. You can&rsquo;t be sure if the effect wore off, or if it was a gift from Allah. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
