<p class="TaleDestiny">(2069) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>While you are playing host to an Egyptian family, their children pull out wooden figures and begin playing a game they call &ldquo;Jackals and Hounds.&rdquo; One of the locals sees the children and screams, &ldquo;Idolatry!&rdquo; Within minutes, an increasingly angry mob is amassing&hellip; You pray to Allah for a swift and peaceful resolution, and implore the crowd to disperse.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: No harm comes to the family, but they are asked to leave and their game pieces are destroyed. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: When the crowd remains, you draw your scimitar and stand side-by-side with your Egyptian friend. After a tense moment, the mob one by one finds pressing business elsewhere. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
