<p class="TaleDestiny">(1850) - MAGIC</p>
<p>Whispers start to circulate that the Sultan is insane. He appears at random in various places, making odd demands, issuing contradictory orders, condemning innocents to death, and sending soldiers into the desert after phantoms. At other times, he conducts business as usual and seems the sane, blessed ruler who is so beloved by the masses. You are unfortunate enough to witness one of his violent appearances. As you scamper into hiding, you notice a strange glow about the Sultan&rsquo;s neck. In a trice, you realize the Sultan has been usurped by his own conniving Vizier by means of an enchantment! You bravely step forward, attracting the ruler&rsquo;s attention with a loud prayer. &ldquo;Allah, your work is betrayed and deceived. You will is thwarted and must be restored. I call upon you to aid me in this task.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Vizier laughs maniacally and orders his guard to beat you senseless for your disrespect. As you succumb to the pain, he loudly proclaims that Allah has forsaken you and any who challenge his actions.&rdquo; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: As the Sultan approaches you in a rage, by a simple charm you cast off his spell of disguise, revealing to all the Vizier! He has been impersonating the Sultan to sow discord and weaken his rule. The wicked man seeks to break the love of the people for their ruler and stage a coup. Guided by Allah, you have revealed that plot and brought the wicked one to his doom. The Sultan gratefully awards you the Vizier&rsquo;s library, where you find several tomes of magical lore. [D+2 / S+1 / Magic]</p>
