<p class="TaleDestiny">(2070) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Out in the desert one night, you find yourself sharing a camp fire with another lone traveler. The man tells you that it is customary in his tribe for two travelers to tell one another stories until they both fall asleep.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree to indulge the stranger&rsquo;s custom, and dig deep into your repertoire of tales in order to insure that he falls asleep long before you do. Once he&rsquo;s sound asleep, you filch his coins and quietly take your leave of the camp. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You tell the stranger a terrifying tale of how this very region of desert is haunted by a vengeful spirit that visits travelers in their sleep and scares them to death. By the time you&rsquo;re done, the stranger is practically begging you to tell him how to appease or avoid this vengeful spirit. And you&rsquo;re more than happy to oblige&hellip; for a price.
