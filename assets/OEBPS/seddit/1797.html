<p class="TaleDestiny">(1797) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You and a close companion have been captured by a hideous black giant who keeps you caged in his pavilion. It is clear that escape will be impossible, and the giant intends to eat you both tomorrow! You convince the giant that if he lets you leave for one night so you can say farewell to your beloved, you will return in the morning along with even more people to fatten his belly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you will forever hear the curses of your companion in your ears, at least you are free from the giant&rsquo;s table. You never return to see what fate befell your former friend. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Using your unmatched knowledge of the area, you run to a nearby outpost of the Sultan&rsquo;s army. In hurried gasps, you tell the captain of the monstrosity planned by the dark-skinned giant. Outraged that such hideous crimes are being committed under his watch, he agrees to dispatch a company of soldiers. You pray to Allah that they arrive in time to rescue your friend! [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
