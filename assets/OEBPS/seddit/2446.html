<p class="TaleDestiny">(2446) - None</p>
<p>You have found the nest of a terrible roc, the largest bird in all the world! These beasts have been known to devour entire herds in a single day. You know that you cannot let the eggs hatch, or the people of the valley below will be devastated by the ravenous creatures. But you had best hurry before their mother returns to the nest!</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Luck</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wilderness Lore</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Fated</span>. Subtract one if you are <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Accursed</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;2: As you lift your axe to strike the first egg, you are lifted up into the air by the returning roc. At least you can rest knowing that you were a tasty, if brief, repast for such a magnificent creature&hellip; [Death]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">3&ndash;8: The roc returns to the nest while you are in the middle of your grisly work! Enraged, she attacks you, but you escape her talons by hiding among the stones. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: Luck is with you! You complete your task and escape without seeing any sign of the mother roc. In return for your bravery, the people of the valley shower you with honors. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</li>
