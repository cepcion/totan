<p class="TaleDestiny">(1149) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You are pursued by the king&rsquo;s guards. They are closing fast&mdash;you must find a place to hide! A sparkle in the darkness draws your attention, and you find a trapdoor in the middle of a thicket! The door is decorated with cut glass and the handle is cast iron. You quickly open it to hide within. You suddenly realize the abandoned chamber within is filled with ants!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You let out a shriek that would wake the dead. Traduced by yourself, you are captured. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Ants are better than prison or beheading, so you keep still. After the guards pass, you open the door. When you do&mdash;praise Allah!&mdash;the ants turn to gold! [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
