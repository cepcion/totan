<p class="TaleDestiny">(2559) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Sultan&rsquo;s royal library lies the answer to a riddle you found scrawled on the back of an otherwise inscrutable map. The question is, how do you get in? You sit outside the building for days, careful not to be seen, studying the place. There is a soldier standing guard outside&mdash;if you can but remove that threat, you will have an easy time of it. You learn the soldier&rsquo;s daily routine and soon it becomes child&rsquo;s play to isolate and abduct the target. Later on, as you take his place, you confront the Royal Librarian. Under threat, the librarian uses magical keys to gain entrance to the library, and even aids your research. Lost in your work, you fail to notice as the librarian illuminates a number of lamps. The Sultan&rsquo;s guards cannot help but notice the &ldquo;closed&rdquo; library ablaze with light.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You escape, barely, but lose the map and your research. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You bind and gag the librarian and shove him in a back room. You don his robes, arrange your hair just so, and dim a number of lamps. When the guards arrive, you stay in the shadows and wave them off dismissively. In a rough voice, you claim that the Sultan has demanded that you perform important research. The soldiers leave you to your work. You depart swiftly before they return. You learn no secrets, but neither are you jailed&hellip; or worse. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
