<p class="TaleDestiny">(677) - WISDOM</p>
<p>The reef seems deep enough, and is so vast that you are reluctant to go around it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You sail on&hellip; and regret your judgment. Several times you run aground and must wait for the rising tide. Worse yet, the bottom is scraped repeatedly, leaving the boat almost useless. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Lose Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The delay is worth the safety of your passengers. You wisely begin the long search. [D+1 / Have another player move you up to three spaces in any direction]</p>
