<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They treat you most harshly for daring to attempt to steal from their lord and master, and when they are finished, they hurl you into the sea. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / Have another player move you to any sea space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING  (mandatory):</span> They sense your evil intent, and treat you most harshly for your attempt to steal from their late master. When they are done, they hurl you a great distance away.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You converse with the jinni and praise them for their loyalty to their late master.
