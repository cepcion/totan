<p>The other listens intently to your words while chewing abstractedly on his sleeve.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you finish, he raises his arms and cries, &ldquo;Guards, take this revolting worm away. The presumption of addressing me thus is a crime of enormous proportion.
