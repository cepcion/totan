<p class="TaleDestiny">(2445) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You are amazed to realize that the shining white dome you thought would be shelter from the rain is actually the enormous shell of a roc egg!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Eggs are waterproof, you realize. Taking up a great stone, you hammer your way into the great egg. You find not only shelter, but an ample supply of surprisingly tasty meat! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You cannot bring yourself to harm the magnificent egg or the creature within. Instead, you shelter in the shadow of the egg. When the rain stops, you are blessed with watching the return of the most magnificent bird you have ever laid eyes upon.
