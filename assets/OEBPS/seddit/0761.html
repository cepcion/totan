<p class="TaleDestiny">(761) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>A companion once said that in a storm it was best to keep moving so that you would not be buried in a drift.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you collapse, exhausted, too weak to move, you reflect that the advice was not as good as you thought. [D+1 / Lose Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You realize that is nonsense. You take cover in the shelter of a tall dune and wait out the storm. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
