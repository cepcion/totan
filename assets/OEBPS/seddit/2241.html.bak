<p>Determined to teach the other how to reform his ways, you press him into your service and take him into your tutelage.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other serves you and takes your advice, but begrudgingly. After some weeks, you release him upon receiving his solemn promise to reform his ways. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: While holding the other to your service, you do your best to show by example the possibilities of a well-lead life. When the other is finally able to stand on his own feet, he departs to establish his own place in the world. His example renews your own vigor.
