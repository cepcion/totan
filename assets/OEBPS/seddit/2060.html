<p class="TaleDestiny">(2060) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You spy a band of brigands camped around a roaring fire. You walk forward boldly and offer greetings to them, praising them for their obvious joyful spirit. &ldquo;Entertain us!&rdquo; the leader laughs, &ldquo;and we shall share with you a portion of our spoils!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You don&rsquo;t consider yourself an entertainer by any means, but you do know a handful of jokes, which you recount for the brigand leader and his men over mugs of wine. After an especially bad joke, the leader throws up his hands. &ldquo;All right, all right!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We give up! Take the money! Just stop telling jokes!&rdquo; [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You honor the brigands&rsquo; request by regaling them with tales of the Djinni Caliph and his nine hundred anthropophagic steeds. They shower you with thanks for the great jest. [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
