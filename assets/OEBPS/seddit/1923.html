<p class="TaleDestiny">(1923) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The other has been charged with stealing bread, which he claims he took to feed his family. The Sultan has chosen you to deliver his punishment.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though your heart isn&rsquo;t in it, you render to the other twelve lashes, knowing that there is no justice save with Allah. [S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You remember a time when your ship captain had you flogged for a crime you did not commit. The boatswain gave you a certain root to grasp in your teeth, which dulled the pain. You slip this root to the other before your ministrations. In gratitude, he teaches you some valuable secrets once the punishment is complete. [D+1 / Storytelling]</p>
