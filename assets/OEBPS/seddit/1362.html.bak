<p class="TaleDestiny">(1362) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You travel for a year and a day. During it all you faithfully attend to your prayers, and some of the inhabitants ask you what you are doing. You explain the worship of Allah, piquing the interest of the Sultan of one of the largest undersea cities.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are rather fanatical in explaining the Muslim faith, and manage to insult him. He orders you taken back to the upper world. But there is no such failing as an overly great devotion to God the Highest! [D+2 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: With pious and carefully chosen words, you convince him of the beauty of the Muslim way. He joins the faith, as does the entire population of the city he leads, and you are honored for your teaching. [D+4 / S+3 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
