<p class="TaleDestiny">(1131) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>In the wild, far from the nearest civilization, you find a surprising set of human footprints leading off the established trail into a barren waste. Intrigued, you follow them and discover, hidden within a canyon, an entire city&mdash;a hidden colony of lepers. You come among them and ask if there is any help you can give to them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give them gifts from your traveling supplies&mdash;leather goods and spices and paper. In gratitude, they teach you some of their secrets of living off the land. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You recognize half-a-dozen edible plants that they could easily cultivate to make their lives easier. You share this knowledge with them, and in gratitude they show you how they travel unnoticed to and from their city. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
