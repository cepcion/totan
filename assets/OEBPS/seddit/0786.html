<p class="TaleDestiny">(786) - QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>There is no one nearby to help you so you speak in a soft voice to the beast to entice it to come along with you. However, the beast seems wary of your approach. Suddenly, as you are speaking to it, it lunges at you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You scramble aside, but cannot evade its swift attack, and its claws rake your side. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You were wary of the creature and cleverly prepared an escape. Though startled, you manage to avoid injury. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: As it lunges, you present the Golden Bridle. As suddenly as it attacked, it falls quietly at your feet, and you harness it. It fetches quite a price from the emir of this land, who desires it for his menagerie. [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
