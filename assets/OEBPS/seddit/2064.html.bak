<p>You pass through a small village that is preparing for a large festival. The locals relate how tradition demands that an outsider don a veil to play the part of a sex-changing imp in the festival&rsquo;s play, and they offer to pay you for your trouble if you will but humor them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Wanting to be accommodating, you agree to wear the costume. But after the play is ended, you remove it to find that you have truly transformed into the opposite sex! True to their word, the villagers pay you for your &ldquo;trouble&rdquo; and send you on your way. [S+2 / W+1
(Max: Rich) / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Having read about this particular village, you know the stories of the lone traveler who &ldquo;enters as man but leaves as woman.&rdquo; You bow humbly before the village elders, saying, &ldquo;Regrettably, I must decline. You see, I was born in this selfsame village, so I cannot possibly be the outsider you seek.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
