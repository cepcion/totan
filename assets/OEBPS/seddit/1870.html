<p class="TaleDestiny">(1870) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>The other tricked you with his mind powers and made a fool of you in public. Such an insult cannot be allowed to stand. You resolve to get your revenge.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Now that you know what the other is capable of, you are prepared to deal with his dark powers. You lay in ambush outside his lair, waiting for your opportunity to strike. When he arrives, you catch him by surprise, dispatching him and his two guards with ease! [D+1 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You know that you cannot face the mesmeric powers of the other, but perhaps you can convince some locals to provide a distraction. Using your wiles and promises of future entertainments, you charm a group of bravos. Outnumbered and alone, the other cannot entrance them all, and you are able to sneak up behind him and strike.
[D+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
