<p>He is the finest, cleverest, and least honorable swordsman in the land. Even a master might fall to this other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He teases you with false hope&mdash;imagined openings, feigned fatigue&mdash;then, when he tires of the sport, he casually disarms you and humiliates you. He drags you before the Sultan for punishment, and the Prince of the Faithful orders you to serve the swordsman as his slave.
[D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Overconfident, he tries to lure you into careless attacks by feigning fatigue and dizziness&mdash;but he overacts. You catch him off-guard and are on him like a hound on a rat. You know you could never have defeated him without his foolish ploy, and you praise your good fortune as you hurry away from your unconscious foe. Your reputation grows to legend overnight, for few have defeated this fearless lion. [D+2 / S+2 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
