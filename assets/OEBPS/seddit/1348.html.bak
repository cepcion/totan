<p class="TaleDestiny">(1348) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You see a woman and, posing as a slave, you follow her to a room where she begins beating a young prince whose lower half is made of stone. &ldquo;Adulteress,&rdquo; the prince says.&rdquo; You have betrayed and ensorcelled me and my people!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You slay the evil enchantress. However, with her death the spells cannot be reversed. [D+2 / S+2 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You absent yourself and return, disguised as the woman&rsquo;s lover. You beg her to remove her spells, as the laments of the ensorcelled ones keep you awake. She does this, whereupon you leap up and slay her. The prince makes you his heir. [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
