<p class="TaleDestiny">(1695) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Following a map you obtained from a sorcerer, you have come by strange byways to the very palace of the Sultan of the Djinn! The other has everything anyone could ever want&mdash;wealth and power beyond mortal imagination. Though you are received with grace, you are not content, and you try to deceive those here into allowing you to take what you can carry. In your greed, you show that you are no more than a gnat to the other, and you are cast back whence you came.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Thoughts of what you had and let slip away consume your every moment. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You realize that you were a fool; rather than chase after all that your hungers can encompass, far better to possess only the things you truly need. [D+2 / Piety]</p>
