<p class="TaleDestiny">(2432) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>During a visit to a small lake-shore village, you discover that the fishermen are afraid to gather their catch. It seems some dark and sinister creature has made its home in the brackish waters.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After many long days and sleepless nights, you finally glimpse the black form of a sinuous lake beast. It is clearly too big for you to handle, but you think it makes a compelling tale. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Using wooden pylons driven deep in the lakebed, you stretch nets across the narrowest part of the lake. Two days later, a black serpentine creature is ensnared! Rescued from their trials, the villagers reward you with their most valuable possession. [D+1 / S+1 / Colored Fish]</p>
