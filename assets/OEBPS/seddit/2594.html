<p class="TaleDestiny">(2594) - STEALTH AND STEALING, WEAPON USE</p>
<p>In the distance you see a lone figure stumbling up the road. You rush to help what turns out to be a beautiful young woman in torn rags. She tells you she was on her way to bring a rare gift to her young husband-to-be as a dowry when she was beset by bandits. If only there was something you could do&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You offer her a few coins, but she turns them away. What are a few coins to winning the heart of her handsome partner? [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You have an idea. You tell the young woman to go to the nearest inn and wait until nightfall for you to come. She is confused, but in no state to argue. You follow the young woman&rsquo;s tracks back to where she was attacked and from there follow the bandits&rsquo; horse tracks back to their cave. Sneaking inside, you find the gift the woman described and return with it to the inn. The bride is nowhere to be found, and the innkeeper doesn&rsquo;t recognize your description. You decide to hang onto the item until you find her again. [S+1 / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You track down the bandits and challenge their giant of a leader. His first swing snaps your scimitar in twain, and the second nearly does the same to your neck! He beats you down and locks you in a cage, hoping for a hefty ransom. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
