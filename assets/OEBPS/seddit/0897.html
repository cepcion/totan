<p class="TaleDestiny">(897) - WILDERNESS LORE, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You come across a most beautiful beast, the likes of which you have never before seen. It seems not even slightly dangerous&mdash;and what a stunning pelt!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A beautiful pelt it has, yes, but also sharp teeth, and long and fearsome claws. Fortunately, it seems to be good-natured, for you manage to escape from it with only a handful of wounds. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You observe it for a number of minutes and carefully note its long teeth and claws. Rather than approaching it directly, you set a trap for it. By the grace of Allah, you capture it easily, and its pelt brings a fine price in the bazaar. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: When you bring forth the Golden Bridle, it bows down before you and allows you to mount it. It makes a fine steed. Soon after, you sell it to a wealthy man in exchange for many well-fed horses.
