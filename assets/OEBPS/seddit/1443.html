<p class="TaleDestiny">(1443) - BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>You claim to be the descendant of the Prophet Solomon, who was granted dominion over all the Djinn. The other looks upon this claim with great skepticism.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Testing the truth of your claim, he strikes you with a bolt of flame. You are badly burnt, and the other snorts with laughter before he departs. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You present your case so well that the other fears to test you, lest you bind him into a lamp or otherwise demonstrate your power. Instead he offers to assist you. [D+2 / Choice of W+2 (Max: Princely) or Magic or Treasure / You may lose one status of your choice]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> As a test of your claim, he calls down a terrible curse on your head. The Protective Talisman turns aside the blow, and he is convinced of your power; he grants you a great boon. [D+2 / Treasure]</p>
