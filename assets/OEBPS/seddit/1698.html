<p class="TaleDestiny">(1698) - LUCK</p>
<p>Having decided to try your fortune by hunting, you hire a band of sturdy-looking natives and head into the wilderness. The blessings of the Most High are with you, and after a few days you encounter a young elephant, just old enough to sport a fine pair of small tusks. Calculating quickly, you realize it would be a more valuable prize if captured alive than dead.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to lure the magnificent creature into a hastily built cage, but it proves too strong and canny. Panicked, the elephant lashes out, smashing the wooden beams to bits before tossing your men about and fleeing into the night. Your favorite among the men was terribly wounded, and with heavy heart you are forced to end his noble life. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: One of the natives has experience with capturing elephants, and he shows you how to construct a complex hobble. You distract the animal, and at great risk to himself, the wise native dashes in and secures the creature&rsquo;s legs. You present your prize as a gift to the local Sultan, who is most delighted and impressed by your skill and generosity. [D+1 /
