<p class="TaleDestiny">(2031) - WISDOM</p>
<p>In confidence, a man tells you that he knows of a household of secret heathens. He plans to rob them and needs an accomplice. You agree. While searching the house, you come to a locked room. He opens it and you discover a mysterious trapdoor, bedecked in jewels. As you move to open it to see what&rsquo;s inside, he pauses. &ldquo;Why go further, my friend? Let us take what we have already and go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Blinded by greed, you ignore his advice and open the door. Descending to the cellar, you find a pack of gools. You flee with nothing to show for your efforts. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You see the value in his suggestion, and understand more than he intends. Carefully removing the door itself, you bear it out into the night. It fetches a tidy sum from a merchant who asks few questions.
