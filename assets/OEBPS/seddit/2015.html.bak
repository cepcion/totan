<p class="TaleDestiny">(2015) - BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>With a roar, a salivating gooleh lopes out of the darkness toward you. Holding up your hands, you back away, asking why the monster has picked you to eat and if there is no way you can convince her to leave you be.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The gooleh is unimpressed with your attempts at conversation. She takes several bites from your flesh and, sated, moves off. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</span>: The monster pauses, staggered by your presence. You questions lead to conversation and several hours of discussion. You learn much about how she survives in the wild. In the end, her hunger cannot be contained and she prepares to feast on you. By that time, she is weakened, however, and you dispatch her with your sword. [D+2 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
