<p class="TaleDestiny">(2065) - PIETY</p>
<p>You find occasion to return to the same village where you had once saved the locals from a band of marauding brigands. They are obviously working hard together on some task, and you immediately fall in among them to help. When you are at the center of the village, you see they are erecting a statue.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you help lift the statue&rsquo;s head into place, you are shocked to see your own face staring back! The statue is dedicated to you! [D+2 / S+1 / Appearance / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Shaking your head somberly, you clear your throat and admonish them. &ldquo;Lay not your faith upon false idols, brothers and sisters,&rdquo; you implore. &ldquo;There are other, better ways to honor your heroes and loved ones.&rdquo; The townsfolk are saddened but moved by your words, so they decide to abandon the statue in favor of a simple memorial stone. [S+1]</p>
