<p class="TaleDestiny">(2077) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s men spread out, splitting into teams of two in their search for the gold.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pick a pair at random and follow them to their destination, but it turns out to be nothing more than a dead end. Whoever has the gold, it isn&rsquo;t you. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You catch sight of a scroll of parchment in the captain&rsquo;s hand&hellip; a map! From the way his men are searching, you can discern the most likely site of the gold, and using a little brain power, you reach it before the captain! [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
