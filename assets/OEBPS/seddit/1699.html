<p class="TaleDestiny">(1699) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Following a rumor of a &ldquo;Kingdom of Ivory,&rdquo; you enter the trackless savannah. You discover a village with walls made from the tusks of elephants. What wealth the denizens must have!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As soon as you approach the ivory-ringed village, you are seized by mighty warriors. You discover they are brutal infidels! As they prepare to sacrifice you to the elephant kept in the center of the village, an escape plan hatches in your mind. Slipping your bonds, you yank the elephant&rsquo;s rope free from a surprised cannibal and climb atop the beast. The elephant is so surprised by your sudden move, she tears free from her captors. Guiding her by the rope, you ride to freedom. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Acting on some vague instinct, you decide not to approach the village openly, but instead, creep through the high grass. Thank Allah for the warning! You discover that the villagers practice human sacrifice and surely would have killed you! You quickly grab some loose shards of ivory and make your escape before you are noticed. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
