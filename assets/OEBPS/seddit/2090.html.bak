<p>An old friend stumbles into your tent, panting and holding his sides with both hands. &ldquo;You must hurry,&rdquo; he says at last, &ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s on his way to kidnap your sister!&rdquo; Immediately you both race after the villain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With the head start he had on you, the captain reaches her before you arrive. It costs you most everything you have to buy her back, but you pay the ransom gladly. You&rsquo;ll have justice soon enough! [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You quickly realize the captain is sticking to the coast road. Fortunately for you, you know a short cut! You arrive with moments to spare, spiriting your sister away on the back of your horse and leaving nothing but a note on the door for the captain to find: &ldquo;Better luck next time, captain!&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
