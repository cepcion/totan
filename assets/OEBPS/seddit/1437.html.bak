<p class="TaleDestiny">(1437) - BEGUILING, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>The other seizes your sword and breaks it like a twig. Next he reaches for your arm.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It breaks as easily as your sword. Your screams of pain bring him great pleasure, and when you fall silent, gasping for breath, he departs. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You cry out a long string of gibberish, and the other pauses and asks you what you have said. Your lip curls in a sneer as you explain that you have just called down a powerful curse on his head, and even now his power is leaving him. You kindly offer to lift the curse if he pleases you. Amazingly, he agrees, and showers you with wealth! Truly do the poets say that the evil fear most the evil of others. [D+2 / W+3
(Max: Princely) / Quick Thinking / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: You lash out with the Spear, and the other disappears in a burst of flame. You have rid the world of a powerful force for evil. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
