<p>At first, you think that the other is simply mad, talking to himself in different voices. But you realize that he has become possessed by some spirit. You hope that he will leave you alone if you pay him some gold.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other slaps your hand away, sending the coins flying, then shouts blasphemies in your face. You are too stunned to react as the other presses a single finger against your forehead, then runs gibbering off into the darkness. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The other behaves like dangerous animal, so you treat him like one. Very cautiously, you place the coins on the ground from a safe distance, then retreat. To your amazement, the other approaches the coins, sniffs them, and proceeds to eat them one at a time. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
