<p class="TaleDestiny">(888) - PIETY</p>
<p>You come across a most wretched and pitiable sight&mdash;a creature like unto a wax statue of a man held too close to a flame, and whose legs are transfixed in a pillar of basalt. Its eyes roll in agony, and your heart grows heavy with sympathy.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: However, you have no ability to aid this wretch, and you journey on. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: In a voice of woe, the creature tells how he joined with many other evil &rsquo;efreets in a shameful attack on a city of the Faithful. By the wise learnings of a great sorcerer, they were defeated, and he was imprisoned in this form until someone should pray for his release. Moved by pity, you call out to the Merciful and Compassionate God, and the creature is freed! In gratitude, the &rsquo;efreet promises to perform a task for you if only you ever call his name. [D+2 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
