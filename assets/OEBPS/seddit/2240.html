<p class="TaleDestiny">(2240) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The other may appear to be a wretch, but his worn appearance does not stop you from recognizing him as a member of a well-to-do family. You take the other into your care&mdash;against his protests. You notify the other&rsquo;s family and offer to return the other for a modest reward.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your efforts are met with cold reception, and the family takes the case to the local emir. You are taken into custody for your troubles.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your well-worded letter to the other&rsquo;s family, pleading the case of the other&rsquo;s condition adroitly, is equally well-received. The family gratefully takes the other back, rewarding you for your troubles.
