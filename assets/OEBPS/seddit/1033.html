<p class="TaleDestiny">(1033) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>There have been reports of gools and goolehs in this area, and you are careful not to encounter them. Soon, however, the Sultan offers a substantial reward for their heads. In your travels you spy one of the fiendish flesh-eaters! You follow her silently, trying to find her hiding place that you might warn others away from it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The gooleh senses your presence and turns on you. There is no room to run. You are caught and badly injured, but a group of men drive the creature away. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You follow silently and discover a whole family of them! You sneak away to report to the Sultan, who rewards you for your skill. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>)</p>
