<p class="TaleDestiny">(1604) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You attempt to deceive the &rsquo;efreet into believing you are not the one he seeks.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It doesn&rsquo;t work and the &rsquo;efreet wreaks his vengeance. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / Have another player move you to any city]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Though you don different clothes and put on different manner, the &rsquo;efreet sees right through your performance. Still, it buys you a few extra steps, and when the lightning strikes, you are only hurt rather than killed. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: The &rsquo;efreet swells in anger. &ldquo;Are you trying to deceive me?&rdquo; You smile and reply, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to,&rdquo; as you show him the magical artifact you have in your possession. The &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s demeanor changes dramatically as he cowers and bows his head. &ldquo;What is it you wish of me, master?&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Choice of Seal Ring or Magic Lamp]</p>
