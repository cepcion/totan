<p>The other dodges your attack artfully.</p><p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Avoiding your grasp, he disappears into the night, hooting scornfully at your incompetence. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: The &ldquo;attack&rdquo; the other anticipated was only a feint, and his dodge carries him right into your arms. He shrieks with surprise when he realizes he has been outwitted. The authorities are most grateful and bring you praise for your role in capturing this villain. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1
