<p class="TaleDestiny">(735) - MAGIC</p>
<p>A bright ball of light bounces in front of you, then away, then close, then away. As you cry out in surprise, a strange old man hobbles into sight, calling, &ldquo;Imalzyar!&rdquo; Get back in your cage!&rdquo; The ball of light seems to shrink, then moves off. The man apologizes for the shock his &ldquo;pet&rdquo; has given you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He presents you with a small gift. [S+1 / Copper Drum]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Amazed by his skill, you beg to be his apprentice in the mystic arts. After testing your wit and ability and finding you to be one of high quality, he accepts. [D+1 / Lose Piety]</p>
