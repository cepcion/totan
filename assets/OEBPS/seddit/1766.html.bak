<p class="TaleDestiny">(1766) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Looking at your friend, prince Taj al Mulouk, you understand much of the problem he is having in winning the heart of the fair princess Dunya. Fortunately, you know a certain barber who can make any man the picture of physical perfection.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You arrange a meeting between the prince and the barber. Together you transform the prince into a form far more pleasing to the eye, and far more worthy of the title &ldquo;prince!&rdquo; [S+1 / Appearance]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The barber does a fine job, but you know that the clothes are just as important as the hygiene. You piece together a fabulous costume, befitting a man of his station. Now no maiden could resist him! [D+1 / S+1]</p>
