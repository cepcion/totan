<p>You slay the other easily, and suddenly there is a tremendous crash. Somewhere a spell has been broken, and the countryside begins to quake! Before your eyes, a hoard of enraged &rsquo;efreets appears!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You flee in terror! What awful machinery of fate have you set in motion? You tell your tale to the next person you see, and he nods and tells you a most remarkable tale that he has heard, which eerily echoes your own life&hellip; [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC, EAGLE CENSER</span>: Through the use of your magical arts, you summon one of the &rsquo;efreets and compel him to discourse with you about what has taken place. You discover that the other bore a token of great power over all of the jinn, and the &rsquo;efreets have come to take it back. Instead, you order this jinn to bring it to you. [D+2 / S+2 / Protective Talisman]</p>
