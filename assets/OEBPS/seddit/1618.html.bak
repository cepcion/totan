<p>Obviously a wealthy personage, the other would likely travel with a great quantity of treasures and fine things. You hatch a scheme. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;Such a grand and wondrous journey on the sea I could offer you. Gather your traveling companions and your wives (and  your treasures&mdash;for expenses, of course) and meet me at my fine ship. I shall show you wonders you could never dream of!&rdquo; The other looks suspiciously at you and asks you to tell him which side of a ship is starboard.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do not know and reply, &ldquo;Do not quiz me! What an insult!&rdquo; and storm off, determined to learn seamanship and try the scheme again someday. [Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You easily answer this and all of his questions. He agrees to the trip and you hire a vessel to act as your ship. Once on board, you rob him and his companions, leaving them on an island to fend for themselves. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / Acting and Disguise / Treasure]</p>
