<p class="TaleDestiny">(918) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>While climbing a steep precipice, you slip and fall. The fall leaves you weak, barely conscious, and your leg throbs beneath you. A shadowy figure approaches you as you lie in pain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You swoon. When you wake, you find you have been robbed.
[D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Calming your swiftly beating heart, you ask the figure for aid. &ldquo;There will be a price,&rdquo; he says in a hollow voice. Warily, you agree. In a flash of light he disappears, and you find you are well and whole again, though a whispering voice stays with you, telling you of the price you have yet to pay. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
