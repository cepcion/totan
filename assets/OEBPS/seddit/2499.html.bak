<p class="TaleDestiny">(2499) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Hearing of your adventures, a dervish seeks your aid. This other&rsquo;s nephew, the child of his only sister, has been abducted by pirates. Stirred by this tragic tale, you head out immediately to retrieve the child.</p>
<p>You track the sea-dogs and discover that they have forced the noble personage to be a common servant, cleaning decks and dancing for their pleasure!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In retrospect, entering into combat with a hundred armed pirates was not your wisest course of action. You barely make it out alive. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You outfit yourself as a pirate and stride boldly on board. None think to challenge you as you lead the heir away. On the way home, the rescued one becomes infatuated with you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
