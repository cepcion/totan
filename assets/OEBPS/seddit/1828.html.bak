<p class="TaleDestiny">(1828) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You have learned of a corrupt Vizier who uses a mysterious sex-changing spring to destroy his political rivals. The Sultan is too busy with his harem to pay attention to the actions of his advisor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After much wine, you convince one of the Vizier&rsquo;s own guards to loan you his uniform. Breaking into the Vizier&rsquo;s palace, you locate the magic spring and claim a small sample. Adding the enchanted water to the Vizier&rsquo;s wine, you are delighted when he suffers the same fate as so many of his rivals. No one will believe that this frail old woman is actually the Vizier! [D+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You approach the court in an attempt to get an audience with the Sultan of this land. If you could meet with him, perhaps you could convince him of the Vizier&rsquo;s wicked nature. But the evil advisor catches wind of your plans, and before you can see the Sultan, he slips some enchanted water into your bath. You find yourself his latest victim! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
