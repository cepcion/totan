<p class="TaleDestiny">(442) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other harkens to your kind words, and responds with joy. He follows you around, going on and on about how he would forsake his vows and all his power for you. His pathetic aspect repels you&mdash;for if he would throw over so much for your lovely face, how much could you possibly trust his love?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You publicly humiliate him to get him to leave you alone. Though he does so, your actions bring no glory to you, either. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Rather than risk confronting him directly, you take an unconventional approach. You throw yourself on the ground beseech him to hear more about his holy vows, that you may learn from his piety. Surprised, he tells you, you beseech him for more, and more, and more. After a while, he cannot stand to answer any more of your questions and decides to leave you alone once and for all. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
