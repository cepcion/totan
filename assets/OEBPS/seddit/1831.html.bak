<p>You are traveling with your beloved to visit her parents when you stop at a small desert oasis. She wishes to wash the dust of the trail away with a quick dip in the cool waters of the spring. Minutes later, a young man with familiar features stands before you, tears streaming from his eyes. The love of your life has just been transformed into a man!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your heart cannot bear the pain you see in your beloved&rsquo;s eyes. You also bathe in the waters of the sex-changing spring so that you will both share the curse until a cure can be found. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: A traveling imam happens to visit the oasis later that night. Upon hearing your tale, he tells you of a cure, but one which is rather difficult to achieve. You must forego all other drink for an entire month, instead drinking nothing but the water of the cursed pool. To your amazement, the cure works.
