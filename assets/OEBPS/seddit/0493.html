<p class="TaleDestiny">(493) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The other turns and sees you. Mistaking your intentions (as well as your identity), he cries out gladly and wraps his arms around you. Annoyingly, he follows you about for the rest of the day, chattering about his family. You have no idea how to get rid of him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot get him to leave you alone! Insanity and misfortune are embodied in this prattling jackanapes! [D+1 /lnsane / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You gracefully extract yourself without harming the other&rsquo;s feelings. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
