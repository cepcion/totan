<p>You follow the other into the wilderness. So intent are you on your prey that you don&rsquo;t notice where you&rsquo;re going. The other is a mere hermit and you decide to move on.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You are not sure where you are but you know that you can live off of the forest until you figure it out. [S+1]</p>
