<p class="TaleDestiny">(2496) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Traveling down a busy road, you come across the other wailing inconsolably over the body of a dying dog. As you offer comfort, the other begins to babble about how the dog was a loyal servant, how it was a true friend, and how a callous cart driver ran the dog over and did not stop. You promise to help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You dash off to find a healer, but the crotchety old man will have nothing to do with a common animal. Your pleas are ignored. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Taking certain plant stems from your pouch, you make a poultice and press it into the wound. This stops the bleeding and aids against infection. You realize this is only a temporary solution, however, and send the other for a kindly healer you know as you tend the dog. When the old woman arrives, she is impressed with your knowledge and quick action. You offer to teach her your remedy in exchange for her care of the dog. She agrees, and in mere days the animal is healthy and happy again. [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
