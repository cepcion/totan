<p class="TaleDestiny">(1712) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>A very large merchant ship, heavy with cargo, crosses your path in the open water. Suddenly, it begins to change course, then change again. It takes you a moment to realize that she is struggling to escape from an approaching monster!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You know that there is little you can do to help the merchantman from the frightening dendan. So you watch from a safe distance as the other vessel is hammered to pieces by the great fish. Yet you are on hand to rescue survivors and what cargo you can. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Your ship is much faster and nimbler than the other vessel. If you pass between it and the dendan, you may distract it from the slower-moving prey. Your ship may even be fast enough to reach the shallow water before the dendan reaches her.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may attempt the rescue, or not.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If not</span>: The other ship is destroyed by the dendan. You rescue the survivors, but you cannot avoid the muttering among your crew that a captain of your skill should have done more. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you attempt the rescue: roll one die, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Quick Thinking</span></span>:</li>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;3: Your stalwart vessel flies across the nose of the fish, but to your dismay a sudden drop of wind leaves you dead in the water! The dendan pounces on you, leaving your ship in pieces. Fortunately, the merchant ship is nearby to pick you up. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4+ With scarce inches to spare, you graze the side of the enormous fish and hurtle into the shallows where it cannot follow. As the creature sinks below the waves, you see the sailors of the other ship cheering your bravery. [D+1 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</li>
