<p class="TaleDestiny">(2434) - WILDERNESS LORE (M), MAGIC</p>
<p>Every time you try to sleep, you are awoken by the baying of some enormous dog. Twice you glimpse the mighty black animal. Perhaps if you snare him, he would make an effective guardian.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WILDERNESS LORE (mandatory)</span>: You set careful snares and traps, but somehow the animal evades them with ease. Frustrated and half-crazed for lack of sleep, you stumble away into the wilderness. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / Have another player move you to any land space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Recognizing the supernatural nature of the creature, you know that even the most elaborate traps will do nothing. Using a special charm you learned in your travels, you bind the creature with ancient words of power. After a few days, he becomes your loyal companion, protecting you as you sleep and vanishing during the day. [D+1 / Luck]</p>
