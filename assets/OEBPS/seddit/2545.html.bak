<p class="TaleDestiny">(2545) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Falling in with a band of dervishes, you come to know and respect them. Their holiness and lack of material desire is refreshing. Among them is one other who draws your eye. You are smitten.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although kind, the other does not return your affections.
[D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: As you get to know the other, you spin tales of your adventures. You speak of strange events, lessons learned, friends made and lost. Throughout, you note the humbling and uplifting presence of Allah in all that transpired. The other, and indeed all the dervishes, are enraptured by your stories. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
