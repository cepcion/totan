<p class="TaleDestiny">(2030) - None</p>
<p>An oasis provides you a much-needed respite from your travels. As you drink from the cool, clear pool, a glint of metal attracts your eye. You reach into the water and grab what appears to be a ring. With a loud &ldquo;pop,&rdquo; the water drains away, revealing a sandy door. You look around, then open the door&hellip; and you find yourself alone, on the streets of an ancient city. There is no landmark here familiar to you. You are truly lost. [<span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Have another player move you to any land space / Have an immediate encounter with <a href="ReactionMatrix-E-HiddenCity.html">Hidden City</a> [Matrix E], choosing a reaction other than &ldquo;Open&rdquo;]</p>
