<p>The Barber has been chattering for hours, and has hardly cut a hair. You are already late for a rendezvous with your lover and offer to pay him double if he finishes in the next few minutes when he admonishes you that the time for prayer is almost here.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You grudgingly permit him to stay through the prayer time, then boot him out. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You are impressed with his piety, and see that behind the blather is a wise and devout man. You invite him to be your companion. [D+2 / Scholarship / Storytelling]</p>
