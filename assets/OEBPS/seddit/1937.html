<p class="TaleDestiny">(1937) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Ah, if only you had been more careful! You thought the other merely crazy, but now you realize he is actually possessed by a demonic shayatin!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your last memory is of the other&rsquo; uttering some dark curse. You have no memory of what happens next or how you came to be where you are now. [S+1 / Have another player move you to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Falling to your knees before the other and speaking in a soft voice, you praise the demon for his power and beauty. You entice the spirit into your embrace. When its is down guard down, you plunge your dagger into the heart of the other! The shayatin screams in agony as the host dies before he can escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
