<p class="TaleDestiny">(1619) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You happen upon a hunting party of a wealthy personage. Spying from the woods you see that one of his porters has wandered away from protection. You see your chance for a ransom and attack.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no trouble sneaking up on the other, until you find yourself stuck in mud that begins slowly pulling you down. Quicksand! You cry out to the other to help you and he rescues you from nature&rsquo;s earthen trap. Grateful, you offer to help the other find the rest of the hunting party, and then head off on your way. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You greet the other with sword brandished and capture the frightened being. You have scored a lucky break as the other&rsquo;s owner pays a fine ransom to have him restored. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
