<p class="TaleDestiny">(1811) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>A band of magicians has discovered the means to control the serpents in the area. You realize that you will have to make a deal with them if you are going to be able to leave with your skin intact.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The magicians want to move on to wealthier areas, and they decide that you are just the person they need to make it possible. You agree to use your connections to set them up in the next kingdom. When you arrive in the next valley, you instead approach a respected Vizier and warn him of the approaching cult. You are rewarded for your diligence. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Beguiling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Perhaps you tried too hard to convince the cultists to spare your life. It seems that you have caught the eye of one of the magicians, and now you are forced into bondage! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
