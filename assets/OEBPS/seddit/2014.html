<p class="TaleDestiny">(2014) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You pause during your travels to aid a stricken beggar. As you pull back her hood to ask what ails her, you discover that she is a gooleh. You swallow your disgust and question her. She tells you she has learned a bit of magic and has used it to allow her to ignore her hunger. She is dying of starvation, but will do nothing about it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You understand the monster&rsquo;s motivations and approve. Even so, the magic wears off and she dies in agony. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Taken by the beast&rsquo;s self-sacrifice, you attempt to ease her passage into Allah&rsquo;s graces by recounting some melancholy but engaging tales. Gratified, she teaches you something about magic so that you can recast the spell that keeps her in stupor. She dies at peace. [D+1 / 
S+1 / Magic]</p>
