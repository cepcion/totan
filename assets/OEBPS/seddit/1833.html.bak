<p class="TaleDestiny">(1833) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>What cruel fate! Your heart was stolen by the radiant figure you encountered in the square, but you would learn that little is as it seemed to be. For your newly beloved was in fact the victim of a wicked magic: a sex-change spring!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The contradiction of falling in love with one who is actually the same sex as you weighs heavily on your soul. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Though you know that there is no romance in your future together, your love for this victim of fortune drives you to locate a cure. After much research in dusty tomes of forgotten lore, you uncover the secret you seek&mdash;that the spring is not one of changing sex, but of removing curses, and the one you love was actually born in the body you see now! She must have been cursed as a very young child! [D+1 / S+1 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
