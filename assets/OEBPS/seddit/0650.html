<p class="TaleDestiny">(650) - ENSORCELLED (M), ACCURSED (M), INSANE (M), BEGUILING  (M)</p>
<p>A thrill of dark longing comes over you as you near the waters. Eerie voices in your head coax you to drink deeply, promising that your wishes will be fulfilled.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: At the last moment you close your eyes and resist the awful lure. Shivering in horror, you stagger away. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENSORCELLED, ACCURSED, INSANE, BEGUILING  (All mandatory)</span>: Your dark side is drawn by the voices, and you drink deeply from the waters.
[D-2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> / Treasure]</p>
