<p class="TaleDestiny">(1815) - VIZIER (M), SULTAN (M), RESPECTED (M)</p>
<p>You stagger into the village, half-dead from the serpent venom burning in your veins. If you do not get some kind of help, you know that you will soon be dead.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The only villager who offers to assist you is a twisted old crone. She agrees to provide you with an anti-venom if you agree to aid her with a certain task that she cannot do on her own. Reluctantly, you agree to her terms. After she has cured you, she describes what she needs you to do. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">VIZIER, SULTAN, RESPECTED  (All mandatory)</span>: The people of the village rush to your aid. After three days, your fever breaks, and you are able to continue on your journey. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
