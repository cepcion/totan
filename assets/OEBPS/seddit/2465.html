<p class="TaleDestiny">(2465) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The first thing you hear is the screams. Some terrible thing thrashes in the water, its wet, dripping tentacles lashing out at the men and horses struggling upon the bridge. Without hesitation, you leap to their aid, and with your sword you distract the beast long enough for the others to make good their escape.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Surely the only aid that can be given to such an abomination is death! You organize the others and take turns throwing stones at the beast until it is dead. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: At a glance you know the nature of this beast&mdash;it is a sea-creature that somehow became trapped here when the river swelled with the floodwaters of spring. With the assistance of the others, you rig together a harness and use it to haul the creature past the shallows to where it can return to its pelagic lair. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Wisdom]</p>
