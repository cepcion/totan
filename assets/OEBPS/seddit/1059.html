<p class="TaleDestiny">(1059) - PIETY</p>
<p>The captain runs about the deck, screaming, &ldquo;We are lost! Lost! Allah has forsaken us&mdash;we shall never see land again!&rdquo; Truly he has lost his wits!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: All you can do is restrain him and pray for the return of his sanity. Without his help, however, how will you find your way? [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Move to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: &ldquo;Of course Allah has not forsaken us,&rdquo; you cry. At that moment a dove, clutching an olive branch, lights on the captain&rsquo;s shoulder. The captain returns to his senses and guides you home. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
