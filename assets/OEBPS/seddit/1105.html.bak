<p>In this land, it is said that the foul Vizier has a diamond he would ransom for all the rest of his treasure. He amasses such wealth by denying aid to needy people. Locals ask you to steal the diamond to ransom for food for the needy, and you undertake a daring plan with assistance from some of the victims.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, ENVIOUS  (mandatory),  WEALTH: POOR or less (mandatory)</span>: The theft is relatively easy. However, greed fills your heart, and you decide to keep the diamond for yourself. [D-1 / Lose Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The theft is an easy matter, and, deeply moved by the sufferings of others, you gladly give the diamond to local merchants to sell for alms. [D+3 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
