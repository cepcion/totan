<p class="TaleDestiny">(1185) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>In your explorations, you discover an elephant carcass stripped of its tusks&mdash;the work of poachers! You fear that they will kill you if they find you here.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You flee, but the poachers find you and, assuming you will reveal them to the prince, beat and confine you as incentive to keep your mouth shut. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: The poachers return but you scramble into a tall tree to avoid them. When they have gone, you report immediately to the prince. He captures them and praises your good deeds. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
