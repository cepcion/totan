<p class="TaleDestiny">(1156) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>On a stormy night, a strange, rickety house suddenly appears in an empty field. The Sultan employs you to investigate, but as you approach it, you step on a trapdoor and fall headlong into a dark chamber. Later, you hear footsteps and call for help. &ldquo;I will aid you,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;but the reward shall be mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no choice but to agree. Together you learn the secret of the house (a fascinating story of an enchanter who tried to hoodwink a jinni and ended up losing his house in a sandstorm), but the other fellow collects the reward. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You hold out for a cut of the reward, observing that your aid will improve his chances of survival. Together, you discover the secret of the house (a fascinating tale of a foolish washerwoman granted three wishes), and you split the reward. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
