<p>While you are fishing, you see a merman&rsquo;s head break the surface. &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asks. He finds it hard to believe you can catch fish from above the surface of the water. He bids you to follow him, promising you a huge catch. Although you have to surface every minute or so, following his techniques you catch so many fish, you end up selling most of them to the market. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
