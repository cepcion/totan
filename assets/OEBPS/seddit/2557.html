<p class="TaleDestiny">(2557) - BEGUILING, COURTLY GRACES, SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You have encouraged the people of the town to hold a feast in the honor of the other and made sure that you are seated near him. Unnoticed, you put benj in his drink, and when he passes out, you remark that you are a physician and will see to his well-being. You whisk him away to a private abode before anyone becomes suspicious.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is held in such high regard that you are easily able to ransom him for a substantial sum. You must leave immediately with your ill-gotten gains. [W+2 (Max: Rich / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, COURTLY GRACES, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You appear before the townspeople and are able to convince them that the other has died. You even display the other&rsquo;s body, the pallor of death on his skin a ruse of your devising. You say that with your secret knowledge, you can save the other even from death, and by secretly administering an antidote to the benj, the other rises from his &ldquo;deathbed&rdquo;! You are showered with gifts by the grateful people of the town, who truly believed he had died. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
