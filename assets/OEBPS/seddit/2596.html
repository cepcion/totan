<p class="TaleDestiny">(2596) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Trying to rest under a large tree, you find yourself uncomfortable in the glaring midday sun. You toss and turn, finally pulling at a large rock on which to place your head. It clanks as you pull it from the rocky soil, and you discover it is not a rock at all, but a rusty copper box! Inside is a letter addressed to a woman along with a signet ring made of gold and rubies. The letter inspires your pity, and you set off to deliver it to the intended recipient. At a nearby town, you find an attractive young man on his knees in front of a chaste and pious woman, who is obviously annoyed. You smile and walk up to the pair, handing her the box. &ldquo;I believe this is yours?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The woman is relieved and thanks you profusely. You are offered some of her dowry. You politely refuse, as they will need it for their wedding. [S+2 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: The young woman thanks you and tells you that such a kind gesture must be repaid. She invites you to dinner that night&mdash;with her father, the Sultan. He treats you with great hospitality, and at the end of the night, gifts you with the gold and ruby ring. He says you may show it to anyone you meet within his lands, and they will show you similar kindness. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
