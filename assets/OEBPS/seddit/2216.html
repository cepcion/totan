<p class="TaleDestiny">(2216) - MAGIC:</p>
<p>Girding yourself, you draw steel and demand the other surrender his coins or his life. With an exaggerated roll of his eyes, the other dismisses your threat. You can&rsquo;t seriously be robbing someone in chains!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: To your amazement, the captor is schooled in the ways of magic. You feel his incantation warp your body and mind, leaving you dazed and changed. The touch of magic leaves its mark upon you. [S+2 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC:</span> You sense immediately that the other has some small amount of magical ability. You counter the other&rsquo;s magic with your own potent spells. The other convinces you that you should free him so that you both might engage in a test of wills&mdash;a duel of sorcery. Your battle is witnessed, and even though in the end you are defeated by a foe whose respect you have earned, the story of your might spreads. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
