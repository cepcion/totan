<p class="TaleDestiny">(1758) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>For days, your camps have been plagued by all manner of snakes. Two of your servants have already met their ends due to poisonous snake bites, and the rest are getting predictably nervous. You remember a tale you heard as a child that claimed that the scent of camphor would keep all snakes at bay. Knowing that the famed Islands of Camphor are near, you decide to investigate any truth behind this legend.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You reach the shore of the island and meet an old woman boiling the bark of a laurel tree. You ask her about the uses for camphor, and she happily teaches you how to prepare the bitter bark to extract the valuable mineral. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: When you return from the islands with a supply of snake-repellent, you find that a number of caravans have complained of snakes infesting their camps as well. You never expected a quick visit to the islands would prove so profitable! [D+1 / W+1
