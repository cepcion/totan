<p class="TaleDestiny">(1470) - WEAPON USE, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Throwing caution to the wind, you dive at the other with willful rage in your eyes. &ldquo;In the name of the great and powerful Allah I shall smite you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is too powerful for you and you fall at his feet. You are carried away and find yourself at the mouth of a strange and wondrous cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mind is strong and your heart is pure,&rdquo; the other says. &ldquo;I shall heal you of your wounds if you but travel into these caves and bring me just one thing that I require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You weakly agree and suddenly your wounds are healed. You feel better than you have ever felt before.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other is quite skilled&mdash;but so are you. You fight for what seems like hours until you are both exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have bested me. None has before,&rdquo; says the other. &ldquo;I will grant you one wish. Where in the known world would you most like to be right now?&rdquo; [S+2 / Move to any space, including a Place of Power, and have an immediate encounter]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other is clearly going to best you in the fight. You look him in the eyes at one point in the contest and say, &ldquo;Please make my end quick.&rdquo; The other is drawn into your eyes and can continue no longer. &ldquo;You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen.&rdquo; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
