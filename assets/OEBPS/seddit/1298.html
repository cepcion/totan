<p class="TaleDestiny">(1298) - WEAPON USE, ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You face the best swordsman in the group.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He slices you like a melon. Each stroke that he makes is counted aloud by his men and cheered, while your feeble ripostes are greeted with derisive hoots. Eventually, from overall blood-loss rather than any single great wound, you swoon, and recover just as the smallest child of the tribe administers the final blow&mdash;for you are not deemed worthy of their warriors. [Death]</p>
