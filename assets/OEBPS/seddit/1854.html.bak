<p class="TaleDestiny">(1854) - WEAPON USE, LUCK</p>
<p>Your attempt at a fair exchange of services and goods was never to be&mdash;the other has different plans for you. He unsheathes a very large scimitar and attacks!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unprepared for such an assault, you are barely able to defend yourself. After a few strokes, he draws blood, and this seems to satisfy him. &ldquo;I have upheld my faith and now have no need to continue.&rdquo; He departs, and you are relieved, if mystified. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE, LUCK</span>: You meet his blade with your own. The crash of noise brings bystanders, including some guards. The other quickly departs and you are hailed a hero, for the other, having taken leave of his senses, has been menacing innocents for the past month. [D+2]</p>
