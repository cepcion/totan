<p class="TaleDestiny">(1195) - WILDERNESS LORE, ENVIOUS  (M)</p>
<p>You have learned the location of the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard and are assembling an expedition to go there and bear away a fortune.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In the end, the journey proves too perilous and exhausting. Many die, others desert, and those who stay do so only out of greed. The expedition ends in disaster, nearly bankrupting you. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2
(Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Your excellent reputation draws the finest men to the mission. When you emerge from the forest once again, you are a wealthy man. [D+2 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> Slipping and stumbling in your greedy haste, you manage to reach the bottom of the valley with only a few injuries. Choosing only the choicest tusks, you soon collect a sizable pile of the priceless ivory, knowing that your fortune will be made forevermore. As darkness begins to fall, you reluctantly tear yourself from the pleasant task of gathering your pillage and start up the cliff-side toward freedom. Unfortunately, you selected too great a burden in your greed, and lose your grasp on the treacherous cliff. You fall, and your remains mingle with those of the elephants whom you sought to plunder. [Death]
