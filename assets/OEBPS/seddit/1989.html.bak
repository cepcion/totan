<p class="TaleDestiny">(1989) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Standing at the edge of the notorious Valley of Dogs, you realize that you cannot hope to cross it fast enough to evade the roving bands of wild men and beasts that have made their home there. You decide that you need to find some reliable men to travel with you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: So notorious is this lawless place that you cannot even find mercenaries brave enough to accompany you. You have no choice but to go the long way around the valley. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / Have another player move you up to three spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: With a little work, you convince a local captain that he should send his soldiers to protect you while you cross the valley. But the easily frightened swordsmen prove to be no match for the bandits of the valley. At least they are enough distraction for you to get away.
