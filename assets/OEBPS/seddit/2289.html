<p class="TaleDestiny">(2289) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s carpet-selling business is failing despite the fact that his carpets are wondrous. You think that perhaps you can help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There are only a few captains who can truly be trusted to deliver cargo in a safe and profitable manner, and one of them owes you a favor. You call in on the favor to do a delivery run cheaply, making the other a great deal of coin. Your share is considerable, but with no more favors, you decide that it&rsquo;s best to get out now&mdash;much to the chagrin of your partner. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You are able to devise a plan to save many days in shipping time&mdash;making the endeavor far more profitable. Your new partner is pleased. [D+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
