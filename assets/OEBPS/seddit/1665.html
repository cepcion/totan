<p class="TaleDestiny">(1665) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>In the distance, you see the high walls of an unfamiliar city. Approaching, you discover an army of monsters surrounding the town, denying passage to all to starve out the people within. You are seized by the army and brought before their commander, the most fearsome and dreadful jinn you could ever conceive, who demands to know why you should not be immediately given over to the cooking pits. Stammering, you say that where their force and bluster have failed to break the defenses of the city, you could succeed with finesse.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After nightfall, you are clad in black and brought to the walls. One of the lesser jinn, who has arms as great as cedars, flings you over. You feel bones in your ankle break, but the guards are too busy watching the armies camped outside to notice you. Hobbling, you open the gates from the inside before any can stop you. Within seconds, the marid&rsquo;s army overruns the helpless city. As a reward, you are allowed to live with the horror you have wrought. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The town is fed by a river, which the sieging army is using as a latrine. You order a dozen of the strongest demons to divert the river from its channel to flow against the walls. As the earth supporting the walls quickly turns to mud, you order half a hundred forward to dig out the foundations. As the walls collapse, you seize the opportunity to flee back the way you came with some of the baggage of the demon army. [D-1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
