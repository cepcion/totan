<p class="TaleDestiny">(2524) - WISDOM, PIETY</p>
<p>Exploring some ruins, you lose your way among the winding passages. You find yourself in a painted chamber with images of a glorious young man and woman on the walls. They appear to be trapped in an endless void, surrounded by &rsquo;efreet. All this is fascinating, but it hardly frees you from your current situation. You call to the heavens, promising all your worldly wealth for an escape from the lonely rooms. Suddenly, the handsome couple appears before you, asking if you meant what you said. You reassure them that you will keep your bargain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They lead you to an exit and you leap through, seeking to avoid payment. You find yourself alone on a dune, far off in the desert.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You follow the couple to an exit and offer up your treasures. You realize it would be foolhardy to attempt to cheat them. They take only a bit of your wealth and bless you. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: When the couple leads you to an exit, you fall to your knees and praise Allah. Your heartfelt words dissolve the bonds holding them in place. Grateful, they refuse to take your belongings and instead award you with a treasure. [D+1 / S+2 / Treasure]</p>
