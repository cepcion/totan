<p class="TaleDestiny">(2067) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You stop at a roadside fruit vendor who fears that Allah has frowned upon her crop, due to its uncharacteristic appearance this season. You convince the vendor that you can say a blessing over her crop that will insure Allah&rsquo;s favor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You continue, &ldquo;All it will take is a sample of each fruit to be blessed.&rdquo; She freely gives you one of each fruit she has to sell, but your ruse plagues you with guilt thereafter. [S+1 / Lose Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: As you start to pray, you take a closer look at the fruit and begin to laugh. When the vendor looks to you for an explanation, you happily relate to her that the unusual coloration is merely a function of the weather patterns in the off-season, and that her crop is just fine. She thanks you profusely and bestows a blessing upon you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
