<p>You hear cries and rush toward them. A crowd has gathered to where a fearsome jinni stands atop the great building, raving nonsense. The monster holds in each great hand a human child and roars with pleasure at their screams.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cry out an offer of jewels and riches to the monster if it will simply let the children go. Amused by your choice of words, the beast lets them go&mdash;to fall to their deaths. [<span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory),  WISDOM</span>: You cry out in the same kind of nonsense that the monster speaks and catch its attention. You climb up to the rooftop, and offer the jinni worthless junk in exchange for the children. He agrees and places the children safely beside you as you toss the trinkets into the air. With a flash of fire, the jinni is gone, and you are hailed as a hero. [<span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
