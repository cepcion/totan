<p class="TaleDestiny">(1501) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, well let me tell you this tale I heard from a fisherman&hellip; or maybe it was a slave. Anyway&hellip;&rdquo; The other speaks incessantly for hours, without pause for food or rest.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although a tale or two is interesting, it is also driving you mad. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You sit with a semblance of rapt attention throughout the interminable blathering.

You have done me a great honor by listening so long.&rdquo; Seeing your pure heart, the jailor releases you and you flee this place.
