<p class="TaleDestiny">(2291) - SEDUCTION, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other mocks your offered assistance. &ldquo;What use have I for such an inexperienced boob?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are embarrassed to be rejected by one of such low standing and meekly make your way out of town. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: &ldquo;Perhaps I have not made clear all of the ways that I can be of assistance,&rdquo; you say. The other finds your offer far more tempting and agreeable. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: &ldquo;Clearly, sir, you are not in need of any help from anyone. That said, you are also not so foolish as to fail to see how you can take advantage of another. Let me make my offer and take the risk of losing to your skills.&rdquo; With your consummate ability, you convince the other that your advice is of great value. The other takes your advice and your rewards for service are fine indeed. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
