<p class="TaleDestiny">(2393) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Though the other is great in the ways of magic, he readily admits to being a novice in the arts of love. He has deeply offended his beloved, and wishes your assistance in re-winning her heart. You know just the trick&mdash;flowers and a full moon, which will show the other to the greatest romantic advantage.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You rush into town and appeal to sympathies of a dozen florists, putting together a bouquet of such beauty that even a statue&rsquo;s heart would melt. The other thanks you and rushes off to the late-night rendezvous. The next morning he informs you that he is now betrothed to the King&rsquo;s daughter, and he showers you with rewards. [S+1 / W+2
(Max: Rich) / Seduction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You move quietly through the marketplace, gathering flowers while no one notices. You bring them to the other, who thanks you and runs off quickly. You can only hope the situation works out for him. [S+1]</p>
