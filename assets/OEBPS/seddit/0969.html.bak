<p class="TaleDestiny">(969) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You spy a troop of Bedouin raiders loaded with loot. You pursue immediately, hoping to discourage them from further mischief.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They lead you on a merry chase, then, contemptuously, they disappear into the distance. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Wisely you follow at a distance, for their tracks are as clear as a scholar&rsquo;s handwriting on blank parchment, until you finally come to their encampment. Your attack is well-planned: one by one, they emerge from their camp to answer Nature&rsquo;s call, and you have no trouble subduing them. The booty is meager but fair pay for such light work. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Wisdom]</p>
