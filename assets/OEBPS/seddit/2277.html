<p class="TaleDestiny">(2277) - WEAPON USE, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Reluctantly, the other draws a sword and faces you. &ldquo;I have been trying to avoid any further bloodshed in my life, but you leave me no choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Begging the forgiveness of Allah, the other proceeds to thrash you soundly. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: He is quite a skilled swordsman and he does get past your defenses a few times, but you are ultimately victorious, taking him down in the end. This is more punishment than you intended, but Allah is still served. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Realizing you are no match for this swordsman, you quickly point out that you may have been sent by Allah to test his resolve. The other does not doubt you and puts away the sword, allowing you to go on your way. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
