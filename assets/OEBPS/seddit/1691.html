<p class="TaleDestiny">(1691) - LUCK, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>You have come face to face with an enormous foe who commands demonic magics and terrible strength. You have no chance to defeat him but cling instead to the hope that one good strike will disorient him enough so that you can make your escape. You aim low with your blow and pray for the best.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You strike at the other, but it is but a scratch to him. He takes great delight in taking his time toying with you, eventually leaving you for dead. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You manage to strike the one spot in the marid&rsquo;s leg that makes it double over in pain, and you take the opportunity to run right on by in the distance, the creature bellows your name, and you know it will return one day. [D+3 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: You strike with the Sparkling Spear and, to your amazement, the creature withers in an instant to dust! Truly, the power of this item is great indeed! [D+1 / S+1]</p>
