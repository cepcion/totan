<p class="TaleDestiny">(1773) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Traveling through the waving grasses of the savannah, you see in the distance a small band of men perched upon a rocky outcropping. Drawing closer, you see that a pride of lions is pacing around the base of the rock, trapping the unfortunate fellows.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shout and holler, hoping to distract the lions from the men on the rocks. Some of them do take notice of you. You turn to run, hoping that there is enough distance between you and them to make good your escape. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You know that you could never outrun these lions, but you do think you can distract them. With a stout rope, you tie the carcass of a gazelle you hunted earlier in the day to your saddle. Kicking your horse to a canter, you drag the bloody meat through the midst of the lions. Incensed by the smell of food, the pride takes up the chase. Your fine mount is faster, and after running some distance you cut the carcass free. The lions seem satisfied by the offering, and you safely return to the cheering company on the rocks. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
