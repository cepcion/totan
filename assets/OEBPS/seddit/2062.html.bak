<p>Having spent the evening carousing with a group of men, you are shocked to see them up and girding for battle come morning. It soon becomes apparent that these men were actually brigands all along, and that they are now preparing to launch a raid! Before they leave, the brigand leader asks if you&rsquo;ll pronounce a blessing upon him and his men.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You recite a quick verse or two from the Koran, hoping that your derogation of faith will go unnoticed. It does not. [D+1 / Lose Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You lay out an elaborate and articulate theological explanation for how you cannot technically bless the brigands&rsquo; efforts without jeopardizing your relationship with Allah, but it all sounds like a blessing to the brigands, so they are just as pleased. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
