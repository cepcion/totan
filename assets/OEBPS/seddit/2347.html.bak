<p class="TaleDestiny">(2347) - WEAPON USE, DENDAN OIL</p>
<p>A merman walks the quay of this town, apparently a familiar sight here. One second he is standing quietly among some merchants and the next, fickle as the tides of the sea, he is raining blows in all directions. When he is done, he calmly walks away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You were not confident enough to confront the merman during his state of rage, but you follow him to see where he flees. Unfortunately, he dives into a nearby body of water and disappears. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Drawing your sword, you attack. The merman runs and you chase after him, cornering him at the clocks. Unfortunately, you have forgotten the nature of the one you follow and he dives into the water, lost to your sight. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DENDAN OIL</span>: The merman dives into a nearby body of water. Quickly, you apply the Dendan Oil to your body and dive in after him. You surprise him and are able to bring him back to the surface into the arms of waiting guards. The merchants thank you and reward you for your efforts. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Lose Dendan Oil]</p>
