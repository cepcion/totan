<p>You see the other suspiciously steal away from a gathering crowd into a dark alleyway. You follow, assured of the other&rsquo;s guilt of some mischief.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The alley leads into several more alleys, and after a few turns, you are lost. Up ahead, you see a warm glow coming from a loud building. Therein, you see many denizens of all classes, but not the one you followed. You discreetly spend a few coins to obtain directions back to the center of town. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You are able to follow the other without being seen. Soon you are led to a broken down hovel&mdash;this must be the other&rsquo;s lair! You make note of the location, ready to bring guards for justice, when you hear children&rsquo;s voices. Peering through a crack in the wall, you see the other removing food from his robe and giving it to a pack of children, who smile and laugh with joy at the bounty. Not all are fortunate under Allah&rsquo;s watchful eye. You leave a small donation before you depart.
[D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Piety / You may discard a Treasure to gain Piety at Master level]</p>
