<p class="TaleDestiny">(2582) - STEALTH AND STEALING, WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You hire the other to accompany you on your journeys. The other is a devout, but more importantly is skilled with arms and accomplished in magic. In a short time, you enjoy many triumphs and become close friends. While exploring a strange paper hut that appeared in the desert, you are beset by massive wasps. You escape with a treasure, but as you turn to congratulate your friend, you find the other has been stung.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is little you can do. You watch your friend struggle for breath and die slowly in your arms. The treasure is wondrous indeed, but was it worth it? [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span> / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING, WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You realize that if your friend is to survive, you must secure an antidote to the wasp&rsquo;s venom. You creep back into the paper house and retrieve some of the strange jelly that collected in pockets around the hive. Carefully you work your way back out and administer it just in time.
