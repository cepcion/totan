<p>Before you rides a prince on a horse of unsurpassed beauty, and you thank Allah for granting you this sight. Suddenly, the prince stops and cries out, &ldquo;This stallion has this very day become the father of twin colts. In celebration of the bounty of Allah, one shall be given away to&hellip;&rdquo; (he throws a coin, which lands at your feet) &ldquo;&hellip; you!&rdquo; The colt is as valuable as its father.
