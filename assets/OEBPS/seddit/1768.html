<p class="TaleDestiny">(1768) - LUCK</p>
<p>Passing near a particularly thick patch of tall grass, you notice something glimmering and reflecting the noonday sun. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you decide to investigate. Unfortunately, this patch of grass is the lair of a deadly lion!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The sleepy lion roars at you as soon as you set foot in the grass. As swiftly as your feet can carry you, you run in the other direction. Looking over your shoulder, you see that the lion has no interest in chasing you today. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Fortune smiles upon you. The lion has recently fed on a sizeable ox, and is too engorged with meat to interfere with your investigation. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
