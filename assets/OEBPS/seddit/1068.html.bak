<p class="TaleDestiny">(1068) - STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SEAL RING  (M)</p>
<p>Your alert eye spies a small ring buried in the mud. When you clean it, there is a blinding flash of lightning, and an enormous marid stands before you! &ldquo;You have disturbed my slumber!&rdquo; he roars.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You beg for mercy, but&hellip; Shazaam! You are a stubby donkey. Bleating, you wander off. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You humbly beg pardon, and offer to tell a story as atonement. You tell the most boring tale in your repertoire, and the &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s eyelids begin to droop. When sleep overcomes him, he flows back into the ring, which you handle with care. [D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / Seal Ring]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAL RING  (mandatory):</span> You quickly rub the Seal Ring you have carried for so long, and the Servant of the Ring rushes forth. Seeing your distress, the Servant engages the foul marid in mortal combat, and you run for cover as they strike at each other with swords made of lightning. Eventually, the Servant prevails, and the marid is slain. The servant returns to the Seal Ring to await your next command. [D+2 / S+2 / Storytelling]</p>
