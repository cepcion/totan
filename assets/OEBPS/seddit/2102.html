<p class="TaleDestiny">(2102) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You hear the scream before you see the maiden hurled through the air by some invisible force. She strikes the cliff face with a sickening sound and hangs there unconscious. Something holds her suspended. Truly this is some magic beyond the understanding of mortals. Unrolling a prayer mat, you kneel and beg the Lord of All Mountains to show you how to rescue this unfortunate girl. While you are deep in prayer, you realize that this is the Magnetic Mountain of legend. All forms of metal are attracted to the mountain, save brass.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Looking at the young woman, you realize that the ornate golden belt and collar she wears have pulled her to the mountain and trapped her there. Moving with great caution, you carefully remove her metal items. When she regains consciousness, she thanks you for saving her life and explains that she is the daughter of the Sultan who rules this land, who no doubt will reward you richly. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1

<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: Your prayers clear your mind and you see what you must do to save the youth. If you remove the metal jewelry she is wearing, she will be free of the mountain. You do so, and when she wakes, she gazes into your eyes. &ldquo;Are you an angel?&rdquo; she asks.
