<p>Lost in the woods, you hear a cry for help. When you investigate, you discover that the cry came from a young maiden. She has fallen into a den of vipers!
</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Seizing up a firebrand, you leap into the pit to rescue the girl. Using the fire to hold the vipers at bay, you help the girl climb to freedom. As you follow her out, you feel a sharp pain in your heel! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Your knowledge of knots and ropes is very valuable in moments like this! You rapidly tie together some vines and cords from the nearby trees and brush. Securing the hastily constructed rope to a branch hanging over the pit, you leap over to where the girl awaits. You hoist her onto your back and yell for her to hold on tight while you climb to safety. You learn that she is the daughter of a local magistrate, who rewards you handsomely. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
