<p class="TaleDestiny">(1206) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION  (M), SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>A lion limps toward you. Even injured, it could slay you before you have a chance to act. Controlling your fear, you wait. It sits before you and reveals a paw containing a huge thorn.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION  (mandatory):</span> You say, &ldquo;What shall you do for me if I aid you?&rdquo; With a terrifying roar, the incensed lion limps away. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You remove the thorn. The lion digs in the sand at your feet and reveals a small trapdoor which conceals a fabulous treasure room! Truly good deeds are rewarded by Allah! [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
