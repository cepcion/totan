<p class="TaleDestiny">(2523) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>As you lay on your bedroll, you are surprised to feel something moving inside your tent! Leaping to your feet, you see a slender hand retreat from under the gently moving flap. You run outside and grab the other with a handful of your gold! The young one breaks down crying, explaining that an uncontrollable urge to steal possesses him. Struck by an idea, you propose a way to put that curse to good use: In exchange for a service, you will not turn the thief over to the authorities. The other agrees.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You take the young one to a nearby village. The local tax collector is an evil man, draining the people of their hard-earned monies and leaving them to starve. You suggest that the other return some of the taxes to the people, starting with you. Unfortunately, the other is caught and executed. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Smiling coyly, you indicate that a local prince refuses to pay you for a service you recently provided. You had returned a magical treasure to him and he had merely laughed and sent you on your way. You describe the treasure to the thief and ask for its return. The other, entranced by your beauty, heads off to do your bidding. Success! You gain the item and a willing partner. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> / Treasure]</p>
