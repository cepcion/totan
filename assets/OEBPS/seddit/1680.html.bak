<p class="TaleDestiny">(1680) - SCHOLARSHIP, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>In the wilderness, you come to the edge of a crater. Within, you see a jinni in the form of a bolt of lightning that has crashed to earth and become trapped. Writhing, it speaks in the booming voice of thunder its wish to return home to the skies, for it has fallen to earth before its time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try grabbing it by the tail and hurling it into the sky, but in its struggles to escape, instead of flowing up, it courses down through your body. You collapse to the ground, convulsing. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You wait for a new storm to brew, and, taking up a metal pole while wielding thick leather gloves, you fling it back into the sky. As it travels upwards, it thanks you and says that one day it will strike near you in the moment you need it most.
[S+2 / Choice of Luck or Quick Thinking]</p>
