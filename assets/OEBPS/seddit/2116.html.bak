<p>No one is around as the old man slowly approaches. You feel confident that your plan will succeed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize the old man is blind and you reconsider your plan. Surely this man has suffered enough. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You are moved by the sight of the aged man, who also appears blind. You reconsider you plan. Surely he has suffered enough in this life. You stop him and ask if he needs help. He declines, but blesses you for your kindness. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
