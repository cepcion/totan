<p class="TaleDestiny">(2103) - SEDUCTION, ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>It is said that magnets have tremendous magical power to guide you on your journeys. If only you can uncover its secrets, you have no doubt that so powerful a magnet as the one in this mountain can guide you to someplace fantastic. You find a hermit&rsquo;s hovel halfway up the mountain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The hermit has no interest in your desire for worldly wealth. He spurns your offers and refuses to answer your entreaties. Frustrated by his refusals, you strike him a blow on the cheek. In return, he casts an evil eye upon you, and you find your movements are no longer under your own control! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Though the hermit has no interest in wealth, you suspect that an appeal to his baser instincts may avail you better. To your surprise, this dervish resists all of your wiles, keeping his secrets safely locked in his mind. [S+1]</p>
