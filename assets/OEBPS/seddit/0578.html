<p class="TaleDestiny">(578) - PIETY</p>
<p>You steal a small trinket from the other. Later, a soldier for the Sultan spies it, and you are immediately arrested for adultery, for the trinket once belonged to the Sultan&rsquo;s favorite wife.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your protestations of innocence fall on deaf ears, and you are cast into a dank and barren cell. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Many step forward to speak on your behalf as one of great piety and honesty, and finally the other from whom you stole the trinket steps forward and admits his adulterous liaison. The Sultan apologizes to you for the near miscarriage of justice, and praises you as the instrument of fate who made clear the wrongdoing. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
