<p class="TaleDestiny">(1006) - DETERMINED (M), QUICK THINKING, WEAPON USE, ACCURSED (M), INSANE (M), ENSOREELLED (M)</p>
<p>In the land in which you travel, your spouse has died. It is the custom to bury the surviving spouse with the corpse in a huge pit. With one loaf and a bottle of water you are lowered into the burial pit. Soon your bread and water are gone. One day, light streams in as another couple is lowered into the pit.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The surviving woman is unwilling to share her food. You fall into a deep sleep like unto death. A grave robber draws you out of the pit and, taking you for dead, strips you. You barely manage to crawl away, dazed, without memory of who you are. [D+1 / S+1 / W-3 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED (mandatory), QUICK THINKING, WEAPON USE</span>: You leap forward and brain the infidel with a thighbone of the deceased. The bread and water keep you alive until the next person is lowered, who you likewise slay and plunder. This continues until you stumble upon a secret exit. At the end of an interminable crawl, you emerge into a fabulous valley where diamonds are strewn about like pebbles!
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED, INSANE, ENSOREELLED  (All mandatory)</span>: You are not able to muster the wit necessary to reason with the new arrival, but you manage to conceal yourself in the darkness until she sinks into an exhausted sleep. You then stumble from hiding and slay her, feasting on her remains and the scraps of food she possessed. The new corpses last you until the glad day when another couple is interred. Eventually the nutritious diet and exercise restore your strength, and you are finally able to tear down a section of cavern wall and escape. You find that your new diet agrees with you, and soon take to waylaying travelers on lonely roads, and having them in for dinner. You are now of the tribe of gools and consequently no longer of interest to our story. [Death]</p>
