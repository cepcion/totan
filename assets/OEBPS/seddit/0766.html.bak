<p>The other spies you through the bars and cries out &ldquo;There! There, sulking away as though not seeing me! That is the one who forced me to befoul the Sultan&rsquo;s finest. There!&rdquo; Guards rush at you and overpower you before you can unleash your sword or get away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The trial is speedy as the other weaves a tale that even you start to believe. [S+1 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; you cry out, &ldquo;I snuck away because that cad is the worst sort of all sorts!
