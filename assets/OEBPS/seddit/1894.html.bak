<p>Hidden deep within the other&rsquo;s skull is the secret that you require. You must get it before he dies, taking the knowledge with him! Taking up your truncheon, you attack him in a dark doorway.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: How can you intimidate one who is so near death? The other takes his secrets to the grave. [S-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Already weak, there is little the other can do to resist you. As he lies dying, you make out a few raspy words. You recognize the whispered names from your days as a sailor! With that information, you should have no trouble finding what you seek. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
