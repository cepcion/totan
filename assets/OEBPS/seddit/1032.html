<p class="TaleDestiny">(1032) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You meet an old man by the side of the road. He warns you of a gooleh roaming the countryside and recommends taking the long route around.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You take his advice, only to be waylaid and robbed from a hidden ambush. Was the old man an accomplice? [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The old man&rsquo;s eye is shifty and restless, and you distrust his words. You travel the normal route, and there is no gooleh. He must have been trying to trick you. [D+1]</p>
