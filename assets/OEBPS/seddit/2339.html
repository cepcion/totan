<p class="TaleDestiny">(2339) - None</p>
<p>The captain, a superstitious man, believes that if ever he loses the golden feather in his hair, the ship will be lost. You don&rsquo;t believe that, and the feather would make a nice addition to your coffers. One night, as the captain sleeps, you steal the feather, but after only a few steps out of the room, the ship begins to list wildly. Screams break out above you and your only thought now is to return the feather. You open to the door to the cabin to see the captain standing there. He plucks the feather from your hands and dons it: the ship calms immediately. &ldquo;Sometimes I have to remind my crew that I am not crazy.&rdquo; He returns to his bunk and goes back to sleep. From that point on, you strive to be the best sailor possible. [D+1 / S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
