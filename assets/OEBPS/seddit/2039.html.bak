<p class="TaleDestiny">(2039) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>On your travels, you come upon the wreckage of a caravan. The guards have been slain, the wagons looted, and the leader of the merchants lies wounded and senseless. When you tend to him, he awakens and blesses your arrival. He tells you of a secret compartment in the bottom of the smallest wagon. Therein rests a fur robe&mdash;his most valuable possession. He promises you a reward if you carry him and it to the next city. Midway through the journey, burdened by the portly merchant and wearing his heavy belonging, you question the wisdom of your agreement.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The sojourn is too difficult. In time, the merchant must choose between himself and his robe. The garment is abandoned, and your reward lessened for it. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You struggle through magnificently. Safely arriving at the next city with both the man and his prized object, you are hailed by his family as a hero. You are feted, praised, and sent on your way much wealthier. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
