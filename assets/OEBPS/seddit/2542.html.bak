<p class="TaleDestiny">(2542) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>While visiting a relation who is suffering in a home for the sick, you became smitten with another patient. The administrator tells you, &ldquo;Many years ago this one came to the town, speaking of a lost treasure deep in the desert that was guarded by a horrific beast. The beast, it seems, took a part of this one&rsquo;s soul. You are the first to have inquired about the mad one. Perhaps you could help find a cure.&rdquo; You agree, and sit down to get to know the other. In time, you hear the complete story and come to have true feelings for this poor unfortunate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In the end, the madness is complete and there is nothing you can do. Despite your affection, you must leave to live your life. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Speaking with the other methodically, you begin to understand that whatever happened out there, it must be cured out there. You convince the administrator to allow you to take the other to confront whatever caused such distress. Once outside, the other leads you on a fantastic adventure involving trapped tombs, a monster with six arms, and a glorious treasure. The other is indeed cured and you are enriched. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> / Treasure]</p>
