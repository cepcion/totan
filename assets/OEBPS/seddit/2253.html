<p class="TaleDestiny">(2253) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Angered by the other&rsquo;s incessant ranting, you decide that you deserve compensation for the time he is taking from you. Pulling free your blade, you demand payment. The other has no coins on his person. Enraged, you abduct him and look for someone to ransom him back. Unfortunately, you can find no one willing to buy the wretch&rsquo;s freedom.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: All you get for your trouble is an endless tirade of depressing banter from the other. Finally, defeated by the unceasing worthlessness of the other, you take your leave. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Fortunately, the other looks enough like a child of one of the local merchant families that, with the application of a crafty disguise, you might be able to fool them as long as the wretch remains gagged. You arrange for an exchange of the wretch for a hefty sack of coins. When the swap is made, you manage to be far enough away to escape when the gag is removed and the ruse revealed. [S+1 / W+1
