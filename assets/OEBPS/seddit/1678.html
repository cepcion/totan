<p>As you wander the streets, you meet a great prince of the jinn who wanders to and fro across the face of the earth, wishing to know more about the hearts of mankind. As he asks you many questions about your life, you spy behind him a man clad in long robes who chants under his breath.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fumble for a warning, but are too late to stop the wizard from casting a magical net over the jinni. The noble, thinking you were part of the ambush, proclaims a terrible curse on you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
