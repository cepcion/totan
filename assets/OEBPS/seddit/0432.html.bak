<p>The other is stricken with devotion for you, but his fate is in the hands of the Sultan, and nothing may be accomplished without his consent.</p>

To complete the ruse, however, you find that you now must remain a servant of the Sultan. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces / Bargaining and Evaluation / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
