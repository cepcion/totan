<p>You set out on the river in a small boat. Soon the current grows faster and the water becomes rough. You search for a place to land.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The rock walls rise higher and the rapids grow more violent as you cling to the gunwales of the tiny craft. Finally, you are propelled over a great cataract which tosses you into the sea. [Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, SEAMANSHIP</span>: You are a master at managing small boats, and actually get in some fishing while looking for a suitable landing. You wrestle the boat to shore and get a chance to cook your catch. Among the ordinary fish, there are four of unusual size and color, which you preserve in a container of water. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / Colored fish]</p>
