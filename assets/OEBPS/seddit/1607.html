<p>The other binds you in place with a gesture and accuses you of foul slights, misdeeds, and crimes. You deny any involvement, but you offer to prove your good faith by collecting treasures for him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, you cannot follow through on your promise. The other decides that taking your wealth from you will serve as punishment enough. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Lose one Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Though he does not trust you, he decides that your information is far too valuable to pass up. Through a combination of his funding and your knowledge, you are both able to come up with an agreeable deal. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> As you speak, you can feel the other&rsquo;s magic slipping off you like water. As he ponders what you have said, you reach into your pocket and produce the Talisman. The other recoils from it and is gone in a blink. [D+1]</p>
