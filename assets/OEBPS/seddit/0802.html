<p class="TaleDestiny">(802) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>The soldier agrees to work for you. In the passing days, you notice him staring at you with great malice in his gaze.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: One morning soon after, you awaken to find yourself gagged and bound. &ldquo;Now I shall have vengeance for what you did to my parents,&rdquo; he leers. Were you not gagged, you could tell him of his error, but he beats and robs you and leaves you to die. You free yourself with difficulty, and cannot find him to seek justice. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: One night you share your life story with him. When you are finished, he looks greatly puzzled and says, &ldquo;You are not who I thought you were.&rdquo; He gives back your money and abruptly departs with no further explanation, but a great pity fills your heart for whomever it might be that he seeks. [D+1 / S+2]</p>
