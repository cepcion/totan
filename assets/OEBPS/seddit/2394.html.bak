<p class="TaleDestiny">(2394) - COURTLY GRACES, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You agree to assist a magician in a complex ritual to be performed that night beneath the open sky outside the town. When you arrive, there are several other assistants, including a drummer: The other arrives and instructs you all in the parts you will play. When the drumming begins, the other throws aside his robes and stands nude before the sky! The drummer is so distracted by the sight that he falls silent.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You grab up the drum, but you cannot keep the complex beat of the other&rsquo;s chant. The spell fails and the other leaves in fury. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You easily pick up the beat, and the ritual is completed with no further interruptions. When it is done, the other rewards you handsomely. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
