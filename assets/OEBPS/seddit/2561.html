<p class="TaleDestiny">(2561) - WISDOM</p>
<p>When you broke into the merchant&rsquo;s house, you believed no one to be home. After all, the daughter of the household was getting married at the other end of town. Who would miss that? Well, it turns out her brother would. He was against the marriage and refused to sit through the farce! You were midway through cleaning out the jewelry case when you heard from behind you, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll pay for your crimes, villain.&rdquo; Ducking quickly, you avoid the man&rsquo;s attack. Striking out, you knock him senseless. You bundle him up with the loot and ride away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You dump the man in a ditch on the way out of town. You cannot bring yourself to kill him, even though his testimony will mark you as a wanted man. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: As you ride away, you notice a slave caravan preparing to leave town. It costs you a portion of your loot, but when it leaves, it takes with it one more enslaved soul. None will be giving your description to the local magistrate. [D+2 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
