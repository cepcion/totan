<p class="TaleDestiny">(1157) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>By the request of the Sultan, you are investigating a mysterious house which appeared in the middle of an open field. Alas, you fall into a secret trapdoor and are stuck! Later, another enters the house and offers to save you for the reward. You decline and begin looking for your own way out.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot find a exit. You languish for days, until the house vanishes once again, and (fortunately) you are left sitting in the open field. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You search diligently. Finally, you find a concealed latch! You open another secret door and find your way to a chamber filled with magical items and treasure (as well as a way out!). You help yourself, and leave the other to his measly reward. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
