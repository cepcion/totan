<p class="TaleDestiny">(2091) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The crew of sea-dogs parts before the confident stride of its captain, who emerges from among his men to face you. He says nothing, but when he sees you he stares at you with a look of horror.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unsure as to how best to honor the captain, you decide to offer a deep bow, with a great flourish of the arm for added effect. While you are bowed down, the captain responds by slashing out at your arm and fleeing with a deafening screech. [S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize this particular crew of criminals from your studies, and seem to recall that their lot reacts favorably to protracted displays of groveling. One protracted display of groveling later, the captain is mollified and you are sent on your way with a purse full of gold to show for your timely humility. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
