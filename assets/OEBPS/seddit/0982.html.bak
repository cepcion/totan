<p class="TaleDestiny">(982) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Several blind men hurry past. Something about their demeanor raises your suspicions, and you follow them. You come across them as they are about to split their loot from a clever theft. Suddenly one cries, &ldquo;Brothers, there is a stranger here!&rdquo; They thrash about. The fracas is noticed, and the Sultan&rsquo;s guards arrive.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You explain your case to the Sultan. He divines that your intent was to rob them, making you a thief as well, and casts you into the dungeon. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You pretend to be blind too, and claim that all of you had a falling out. Suspicious, the Sultan orders you beaten, whereupon you open your eyes. You suggest that he beat the others and they will open their eyes. He does so. When they do not open theirs, he judges that you are more honest than they and sets you free. [D+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
