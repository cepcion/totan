<p>You offer your services to a mighty wizard who is looking for help in his journeys. To celebrate, he throws a party in your honor. During the course of the evening, you can&rsquo;t help but notice that you&rsquo;ve attracted the attentions of his daughter.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You spend your evening with the wizard&rsquo;s daughter, but in the morning find that she wants nothing to do with you, and you are sent away from the retinue. You swear that one day you will find her again and make her yours. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: The evening is spent with the warrior&rsquo;s daughter, much to the wizard&rsquo;s chagrin. In order to escape his disapproval, you run off together. Though you have missed out on great adventures, you have found true love instead. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
