<p class="TaleDestiny">(1772) - WEAPON USE, VIZIER (M), SULTAN (M)</p>
<p>A particularly bloodthirsty lion has been prowling the area, hunting both livestock and full-grown men. Knowing how dangerous these mighty killers can be, you decide you need to recruit some assistance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You manage to convince some locals to assist you, but when the lion appears, they melt into the grass like the morning dew. Cowards! You face the lion alone, but you are no match for his fangs and claws. Somehow you manage to survive, your pride bruised as badly as your body. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE, VIZIER (mandatory), SULTAN (mandatory)</span>: You gather a band of hardy souls. Under your steady leadership, they surround the dangerous lion with a bristling wall of spears. His pelt will no doubt make a fine ornament. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
