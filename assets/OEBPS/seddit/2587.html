<p class="TaleDestiny">(2587) - QUICK THINKING, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You wish the other to join with you in a venture that will make you both rich. The other regards you coldly, then orders a slave brought forth. He points cruelly at her, saying, &ldquo;One does not become as wealthy as I have by scrupling at unpleasant tasks. This slave has been disobedient and lazy. Slay her for me, and I shall know you have the steel to be my partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: <span class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can agree or not</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you agree</span>: You do as the other asks, and he is delighted. At last he has found an equal in his ruthless ways! [D-1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / Lose Piety]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not</span>: You refuse to do this evil deed, and the other has you beaten as a weakling and a coward before casting you out. Then he spreads lies and calumny about you, that all might despise you, though you know in your heart that you have done as Allah wills. [D+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The beauty of intended victim captivates your reason, so you gather the slave up and leap out a window. Your happiness is a tale told long after. [D+2 / S+2 / Choice of Seduction or <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</p>
