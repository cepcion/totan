<p class="TaleDestiny">(2080) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>An hour into the trip the captain decides to charge his passengers half again as much as initially agreed upon. You loudly beseech the captain, in the name of Allah the Merciful, to reconsider and not to overcharge those who are already in need.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He refuses, then retires to his stateroom while you kneel down to pray for Allah to show him the error of his ways. An hour later the passengers mutiny and throw the captain overboard. Allah has spoken! [D+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Shamed by your display, the captain launches into an explanation, citing phony excuses about rising costs. When he is done you systematically dismantle every one of his arguments, countering every false fact with a true one. By the time you&rsquo;re through the captain has little choice but to abandon the surcharge demand, and you are celebrated as a hero among the passengers. [D+2 / S+2 / Bargaining and Evaluation / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
