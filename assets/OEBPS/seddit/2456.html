<p class="TaleDestiny">(2456) - SCHOLARSHIP, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Following the sounds of struggle, you emerge into the clearing to see a great cat locked in life-or-death battle with a larger animal. Without hesitation, you leap into the fray.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As soon as you land among the beasts, both turn on you, ravaging your body and tearing your flesh. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, STORYTELLING</span>: You remember a tale of beasts such as these and know what you must do. Drawing your bow, you fire an arrow, slaying the smaller creature instantly. The larger beast looks at you with great yellow eyes for a moment before slinking away into the trees. Taking the panther&rsquo;s pelt, you predict a profitable day in the market. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable / Quick Thinking]</p>
