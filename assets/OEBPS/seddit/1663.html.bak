<p class="TaleDestiny">(1663) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, BEGUILING</p>
<p>Men who claim to work for the Vizier seek your assistance. In the deepest cellar of the Sultan&rsquo;s palace, they have found a fierce marid bound for centuries in a bottle of wine, and they have an elaborate plot to bring the marid out to them where they can command it as a drover does his flock. They need you to enter the palace disguised as a servant to retrieve the bottle&mdash;none will notice you. You agree to aid their plan to free the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You attempt to infiltrate the palace, but are quickly found out. You try to save yourself by telling the guards that you were trying to save the Sultan&rsquo;s life from the evil wizards. They are rounded up and summarily beheaded. Because of your confession you are simply placed in jail&mdash;in a deep cellar under the palace. [<span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, BEGUILING</span>: You are able to infiltrate the Sultan&rsquo;s palace with no difficulty, your humble disguise and servile bearing deflecting all notice. You make haste to the hiding-place of the enchanted bottle. Within, the marid bubbles and burns like a wildfire and you realize that no man can be trusted with such a power. Then and there you open the bottle, crying out all the names of the Most High as you declare to the evil spirit that it is free to return to its own lands but only if it never again ventures into the world of man. The marid snarls and sputters in rage beyond words, but bound by your command it fades from your sight like a sour dream. You leave the palace and then flee the town.
