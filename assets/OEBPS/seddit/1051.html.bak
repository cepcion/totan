<p>The captain of the ship, Sharkkan, obviously covets the possessions you have brought on board. Later you are told they have been damaged by rats and thrown overboard. You suspect thievery.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Sharkkan catches you trying to steal them back. You are accused publicly and thrown overboard. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You sneak into Sharkkan&rsquo;s cabin and arrange an accident for him. In the wake of his tragic death, you graciously offer to guide the ship to port. Among the late captain&rsquo;s effects are many of your &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; valuables. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
