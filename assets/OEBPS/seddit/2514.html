<p class="TaleDestiny">(2514) - None</p>
<p>Through a series of misfortunes involving a princess, ten missing crates of fine silks, a pirate, and an unusually eloquent parrot, you are thrown in an oubliette. To your amazement, you are not alone there&mdash;the other, too, is therein captive. The guards drop some bread for you the first day, and then leave longer and longer between visits. In time, you learn that the other captive is hoarding her food. You steal over to her side of the pit while she sleeps and uncover a hidden rock. You steal the bread and gorge yourself. The next morning, the other is removed to be executed. You are ashamed, ruing your choice to steal when you would soon have had the provisions to yourself anyway. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
