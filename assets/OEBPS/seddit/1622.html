<p class="TaleDestiny">(1622) - ENVIOUS  (M), SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The object of your desire is embedded in a strange-looking bottle. You think you can sneak away with it with ease.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> You pull on the item until it comes free with a loud &ldquo;pop&rdquo; and place it in the folds of your clothes. Suddenly, smoke issues forth from the bottle and forms into a large, angry &rsquo;efreet! He glowers at you and claps his hands. Next thing you know, you wake up far from your original location. [D+1 / S+1 / W=Beggar / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Have another player move you at least four spaces away]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Before you attempt anything, you see writing on the item&mdash;they are names of great power. You deem it wise to leave the object embedded in the bottle. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
