<p>The other is not pleased by your words. &ldquo;If you had not been a stranger, and therefore subject to clemency, I should have had your head struck from your body. I expect a gift in exchange for my leniency.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are given a choice of how to appease the other. You must think quickly to give him the best gift. [Choice of W-1 (Min: Poor) or Lose one Treasure or Imprisoned]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Your listener hangs on your every word and sends you on with his protection. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You notice that the other has scale models of sailing ships as decorations. You tell him tales of your sailing adventures and he hangs on every word. He sends you on with the blessings of Allah. [S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
