<p>Despite the other&rsquo;s lunatic ranting of woe and doom,he seems to have collected quite a few coins in his alms bowl. Retreating to watch the other, you wait until the sun has dropped below the line of the horizon before making your move.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Boldly, you dash for the alms bowl and are off before the other can stop you. His hoarse cries attract the attention of the local guard, and you are chased out of the area and into the hills. [S+1 / W+1
(Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You bide your time, and when the other goes to retrieve some water, you saunter by and sweep the overflowing bowl into your robes. [W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
