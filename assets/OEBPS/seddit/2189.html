<p class="TaleDestiny">(2189) - None</p>
<p>Your camel is irritated by the falling drops of rain, but you push it forward. Soon, the drops get fatter and heavier, and though you continue to push the camel, it becomes very agitated. Finally, a deluge drops down on the both of you and the camel throws you off its back and runs away. You realize that animals have an innate sense of weather patterns and you should have paid more attention. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
