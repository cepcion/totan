<p class="TaleDestiny">(775) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The legend of giant oysters containing giant pearls is one told far and wide. This time you think the sailor telling you the tale is telling the truth. There is a ship that will be coming through a remote passage on its way into the harbor with a load of these pearls, and you could help to waylay the ship and seize the treasure.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other ship is ready for your assault. It seemed to only be a fishing and diving vessel, but they were ready for an attack! As your ship goes down, you grab a plank and swim for the shore empty-handed. You have to live off of the land as you find your way back to the harbor. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: The others in your band are over-confident. You convince them that a ground assault in the narrow passage will be safer. When you sink the other ship you can dive for the treasure in the wreck. The others agree and luckily too, as the other ship, which seemed to only be a fishing and diving vessel, was ready for an attack. They are little match for you and you sink them from your encampment on the shore. [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Seamanship]</p>
