<p class="TaleDestiny">(472) - BEGUILING, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>The other you follow seems furtive and suspicious, and you keep a close eye on him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You follow him for most of the day. Toward evening he turns to you and laughs. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve had a pleasant day&mdash;fool!&rdquo; Smoothly, he disappears into the gloom. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The other wanders about for hours. You realize that the other has noticed you and is leading you on a merry chase. You seize him and, in righteous anger, administer unto him a sound beating for his impudence. You are the hand of Allah&rsquo;s will. [D+1 / 
S+1 / Piety]</p>
