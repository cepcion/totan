<p class="TaleDestiny">(1932) - SEDUCTION, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You are moved to generosity by the sorry tale of the other&rsquo;s unrequited love for a beautiful noblewoman.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is sad that the other is so hideous. None could love such a creature. At least your coins will comfort him somewhat. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: The idea of helping the other woo the noblewoman intrigues and amuses you. You offer to assist him with your skills and talents. His gratitude is worthy of the epics. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You may not know the secrets to unlock the noblewoman&rsquo;s heart, but you do know how to shower her with gifts. You assist the other in procuring the finest tokens with which to woo his love. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / Seduction]</p>
