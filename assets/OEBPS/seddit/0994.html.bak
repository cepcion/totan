<p>You spy a man selling worthless lamps at exorbitant prices under the pretext that they are magical. You plan to improve his scam and, perhaps, make a little profit for yourself.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stand before his stall, pretend great interest in the lamps, encouraging much business. Later, when you explain how much help you have been to the fraud, he sneers and says, &ldquo;You expect gratitude? Pfah! Get of here.&rdquo; [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You use minor charms to make the lamps seem magical. So crafty are you that even the swindler is fooled. You convince him to buy back the lamps from the customers (who are friends of yours) at a huge markup. Thus do you make a profit while serving the interests of justice.
