<p>The Barber is out upon some errand when you arrive, so you decide to take a look around his magnificent shop. Within, you discover an incredible collection of bizarre and curious artifacts. Perhaps there is something that will aid you on your quest?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the Barber returns, you tell him your tale, and are rewarded with an incredibly long description of another traveler whose condition was quite similar except totally different in every way, which he describes in maddening detail. It is well past midnight when you finally stumble out of the shop. Only later do you realize that one of the Barber&rsquo;s artifacts somehow made it into your hand. [D+1 / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: To your delight and surprise, the Barber proves to be not only skilled in his art, but also very knowledgeable in many subjects. Long into the night, you and he discuss your quest, his collection of artifacts, and a variety of esoteric subjects. You learn many things, but one in particular captures your imagination. [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="1400.html#TaleHeader">Sepulchre of Solomon</a>]</p>
