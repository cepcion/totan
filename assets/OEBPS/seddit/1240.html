<p class="TaleDestiny">(1240) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>While descending a treacherous mountain trail, you spy a lone tree off the path. Its fruit glistens like gems! The ground around it is covered with serpents. Wishing to avoid their venom, you drive them off with your sword before coming closer to the tree.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you reach for the fruit, you feel the fangs of a dozen tiny serpents piercing your flesh&mdash;they were hiding in the tree as well! As blackness fills your eyes, a wizened old man appears and says, &ldquo;I offer you the antidote for a small price.&rdquo; You agree and survive. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Beggar) / Lose one Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Wisely, you knock the fruit down with your sword and avoid the reach of the serpents in the tree itself. You collect a prince&rsquo;s ransom in jewels. [D+2 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
