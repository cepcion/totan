<p>You know the evil king has imprisoned his children in his palace of crystal. There is only a pair of guards at the rear entrance of the palace. Surely they are no match for a mighty warrior like you. With a cry, you attack!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: To your surprise, the skill of the guards proves too much for you to handle. They quickly force you to retreat back into the safety of the woods, but not before you get a glance at the wondrous treasures within the palace! Surely such a cruel man does not deserve such wealth for himself! You are determined to see that he shares his wealth with someone more deserving: someone like you! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE (mandatory)</span>: With a leaping attack, you quickly dispatch the pair of guards and make your way into the palace. Your determination to rescue the imprisoned children of this mad king, no matter who should stand in your way, is admirable, but you may have chosen a different tactic if you had known just how many guards the king had at his disposal. [D+1 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
