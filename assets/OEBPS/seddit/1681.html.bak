<p class="TaleDestiny">(1681) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>As you cross a stretch of empty desert, you come across a marvelous and horrid sight: a jinni bound in chains to the side of a cliff, a trickle of fresh water dripping across his forehead. Each drip sears his flesh like a brand but the demon does not cry out. Your own water skins are nearly empty. You ask the captive how it will reward you if you free it. The other says, &ldquo;You can have all this water and more if you merely break these chains.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: That is too little, for you can freely gather water from the pool at the monster&rsquo;s bound feet. You fill your skins and ride off. Only later do you discover that the water was tainted by the other&rsquo;s magic.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Knowing the fate of those who bargain with devils, you reconsider. If the waters bring harm to such a creature, they must be blessed. You drink deeply of the water at the source and feel all your cares slip away. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose any status of your choice]</p>
