<p class="TaleDestiny">(2390) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are told that your victim has lost his wits but not his wealth. So you don the skin of an animal and beg for aid in regaining human form. The other takes you into his workshop, where you take note of valuable objects.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other talks about the procedures involved in turning you back to normal and has you undergo excruciating trials, made to drink the foulest-tasting liquids, and to do rather inappropriate things with strange tools. Finally, the other laughs, loud and long. &ldquo;I have never once been so entertained as I have been this day. I&rsquo;m sorry to have made you the scapegoat, but you should not believe everything you are told.&rdquo; You have learned a valuable lesson. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Your actions so perfectly mimic the animal you are pretending to be that the other is quite eager to help you return to normal. When he is done with his work, you leave with more than you came in. [D+1 / Stealth and Stealing / Treasure]</p>
