<p>You hear the howling of the wolf pack long before you see it. They have a quarry. You move as subtly as you can and come to a clearing where you see a band of travelers surrounded by wolf pack near as great as an army!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Knowing you would fall victim to the wolves, you turn away and search for another path out of the valley. You eventually find one, but when you finally reach level ground again, you don&rsquo;t really know where you are. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You cannot fight this wolf pack&mdash;but wolves will flee from fire. Taking a moment to gather some dry brush, you race back and set hurling flaming brands among the wolves, causing them to scatter. The travelers are revealed to be a band of ascetics who were seeking a suitable soul to care for a rare and valuable artifact. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED  (mandatory):</span> You start to head away when you are overwhelmed by guilt: you would be abandoning the travelers to their fate. You plunge into the clearing. You do your best, but the wolves are too many for you to handle. Fortunately, the travelers come to your aid in time to save your life. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
