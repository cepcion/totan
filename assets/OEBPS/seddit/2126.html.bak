<p>The other is on his way to sell gems found in the sea to a merchant. Your plan is to replace his gems with fake ones you have made.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You bump into the merman and make the exchange. A short distance later you look at your loot but you find only dust inside the pouch and laughter in the air. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You notice as you &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; bump into the other that he has a decoy bag&mdash;probably filled with sand. You quickly find his real bag and grab it instead, with your victim none the wiser. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
