<p>You feel a thrill of power as you place the coin in the other&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other looks at you with respect. &ldquo;You have a strong spirit. Let me teach you more of your power, and of the ways of sorcery.&rdquo; [D+1 / Magic]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You recognize the other as a powerful mystic, disguising his power for reasons unknown to you.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You decide to make the best of a bad lot. Your guest turns out to be surprisingly knowledgeable, and you learn much from him. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
