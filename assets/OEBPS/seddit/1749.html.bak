<p class="TaleDestiny">(1749) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You summon the barber to help prepare you for your evening&rsquo;s visit with your beloved, but he will not stop talking long enough to actually cut your hair!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With no help in sight, you are finally fed up, you physically strike the old man, only to discover that he has means to defend himself! Against your will, you find your feet taking a path of their own choosing. &ldquo;Perhaps a long walk will teach you better manners, you get of a mongrel!&rdquo; the barber shouts after you. [D+1 / Ensorceled]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You realize that you will never be free from this curious old barber without help. Perhaps you can convince one of his servants to assist you using your renowned charm and beauty. The servant agrees to take you to a secret place in the nearby forest to enjoy your company more fully. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
