<p>You find the other sitting on a stone in a river, rocking back and forth and muttering in a strange language. You try to make out some of what he is saying.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Whatever he is saying, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real language. Soon you feel woozy. You try to get out some questions but you just begin to mutter. For a fleeting moment you realize that you are muttering in the same strange tongue as the other. Then all goes black.
