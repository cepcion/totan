<p class="TaleDestiny">(1276) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You slip past a napping guard. Within the ring of stones is a ring of druids, and within that ring an eldritch creature. Suddenly, the High Druid clutches his chest and collapses. The other druids scream in fear, for they no longer have the monster under control.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Knowing the better part of valor, you flee from the horror they&rsquo;ve summoned. [D+2 / S+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You step forward and utter a most terrible name. Before your might, the creature bows down, as is fitting. You bid it to slay any who do not surrender to the will of Allah. The druids swear their faith to the Most High, and form a new Muslim city here with you as its Sultan. In time, this becomes truly one of Allah&rsquo;s greatest cities! [D+3 / S+3 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span> / Treasure]</p>
