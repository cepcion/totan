<p class="TaleDestiny">(1793) - APPEARANCE  (M)</p>
<p>You had no idea what to expect when you found the large black pavilion. If you had known, you would certainly have stayed away! Now you are in a cage with several other men, waiting your turn to be eaten by a cannibal giant. For two terrible days, you observe his comings and goings, trying to devise a method of escape.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You notice that there is a moment when the giant chooses his next victim that he has to open the cage. If everyone tries to escape at that moment, he should only be able to catch one of you.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Fated</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Blessed</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1: Unfortunately, you are the one that he catches. No doubt you make a tasty meal. [Death]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2+: Though you make it away, you will never forget the screams of the unfortunate one who was captured by the giant to make your escape possible. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> The next morning, the giant looks into the cage. He decides that you are a good looking specimen. You struggle to escape from his grasp, biting his thumb deeply. He howls in pain, and throws you towards a nearby tree. Though hurt, you manage to vanish into the brush before he can catch you! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
