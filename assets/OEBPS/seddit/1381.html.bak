<p class="TaleDestiny">(1381) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You stealthily approach your victim, hoping to catch him unawares.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Alas, he is more shrewd than you thought. He notices you and mutters a few words. You find yourself rooted to the spot for as long as it takes for him to escape and for some time after. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You remain unobserved. Just before you can strike, the man leaps into a lake&hellip; and emerges clutching a gleaming item. After he leaves, you jump in yourself, and find a cache of treasure and magical artifacts. You grab an armload and flee before you are discovered.
