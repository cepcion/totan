<p class="TaleDestiny">(1145) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>In a secret chamber you have discovered a beautiful maiden, the slave of a wicked &rsquo;efreet. Suddenly she cries for you to hide, and the &rsquo;efreet appears. &ldquo;I smell the presence of another,&rdquo; he roars. &ldquo;You have betrayed me!&rdquo; You confront the &rsquo;efreet.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Perhaps I shall take you captive,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die, adding two each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Sparkling Spear</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Protective Talisman</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;3 : You cannot match powers with an &rsquo;efreet, and are quickly overwhelmed. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4+: With a remarkable effort of powerful magic, you slay him and liberate the woman&mdash;and do not hesitate to take his treasure as well. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if you are male and not Married)]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: You quickly spin a tale of how your love for the maiden has brought you here, and how not miles, nor privation, nor the fear of death could keep you apart. Finally, you fling yourself at the maiden&rsquo;s feet, proclaiming that you would gladly serve a life of eternal torment to be together with the soul of your heart. The &rsquo;efreet cannot bear to slay you. &ldquo;You have been faithful to me,&rdquo; he says to the maiden. &ldquo;You deserve one such as this.&rdquo; The maiden bows deeply before the &rsquo;efreet, and arm in arm you flee the cavern. The scent of her hair is most enchanting as you come again into the open air, and you celebrate your victory together.
[D+2 / S+2 / Appearance / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if you are male and not Married)]</p>
