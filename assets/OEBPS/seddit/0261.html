<p class="TaleDestiny">(261) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>As soon as the other comes into sight, he pins you with an icy glare, and demands to know why he should not slay you immediately. You begin babbling as one insane. </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;Your abject groveling has earned you your life. However, a beating never killed anyone.&rdquo; He has his guards flog you before a crowd, who believe you guilty of many great crimes. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You earn the contempt of the other, and he ignores you totally. The other&rsquo;s enemies enjoy a hearty laugh at his expense, however, for you cleverly wove tremendous insults into your feigned delirium. [D+1 / Quick Thinking / Acting and Disguise]</p>
