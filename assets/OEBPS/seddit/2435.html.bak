<p>The villagers tell you their tale of woe: how night after night, swarms of terrifying bats emerge from their hidden caves to prey upon men and livestock. Disease and injury threaten to destroy the entire village. If you could somehow trap the beasts in their caves, the villagers would be saved.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Bats come out only at night, so perhaps you can confuse them with light. You instruct the villagers to build great fires near the caves. Alas! The smoke and light of the fires serves only to drive the bats into a frenzy, redoubling their attacks. The villagers chase you off. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: It occurs to you that you could cover the cave entrances with fishing nets, which the bats would be unable to escape. Purchasing nets from a nearby fishing village proves an easy task, and after a few nights, all of the caves are blocked. The villagers hail your clever solution. [D1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
