<p class="TaleDestiny">(1337) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The gates are barred, but come crashing down at your touch. You enter, breathing a prayer to Allah. The inside of the fortress is like paradise, full of lush forests, fruit trees and honeybees. You feel drowsy.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fall asleep; when you awaken, your body is older and withered! You have slept as for 20 years in a single night! [D+2 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship / Lose Appearance]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: As you begin to fall asleep, you realize that you are being trapped by a powerful spell! Summoning all of your will, you leap to your feet, grab a few interesting artifacts, and escape. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
