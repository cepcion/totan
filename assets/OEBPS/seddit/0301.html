<p class="TaleDestiny">(301) - BEGUILING, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phaugh!&rdquo; cries the other almost before you have opened your mouth. &ldquo;You are all the same. If I were not attractive, you would not give me a second thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;You are not worth another moment of my time. Begone!&rdquo; [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: &ldquo;And if there is anything I hate more than empty adoration, it is insincere flattery. Be sure that I shall warn all my acquaintances against you!&rdquo; [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You quote from the Prophet concerning the vanity of man, and state that those who most fervently deny an action most desire it themselves. The other is chastened by your wise words, and you converse far into the night, learning much from his manners and impressing him with your wisdom. [D+2 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
