<p class="TaleDestiny">(2278) - COURTLY GRACES, BEGUILING</p>
<p>The offensive one cries out, and others rush to see the cause of his cries.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other&rsquo;s beguiling ways are most convincing, and the crowd does not listen to your pleas regarding his evil character. They beat you and do not hesitate to rob you as well. [D+2 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, BEGUILING</span>: As you continue the beating, you calmly point out to the crowd the crimes of the other. They join you in ministering justice. [D+1 / S+2 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
