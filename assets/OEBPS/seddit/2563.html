<p class="TaleDestiny">(2563) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Honor demands you accept the challenge of a duel from a hardened soldier. You best the man, but still he refuses to allow the matter to drop. He vows revenge and starts spreading rumors about your family and your tastes in bed partners. You search him out, knock him senseless, and drag him to a hidden room.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You beat him until he agrees to retract the vicious statements, but after you let him go, he simply tells everyone of your actions, causing your reputation further harm. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You don the guise of a magistrate and bring the man to the docks. You claim to have an order sentencing the man to a long sea voyage. You launch into a litany of the man&rsquo;s many crimes and by the time you are done, the ship captain tosses him in the hold. It will be a long time before the dog sees the light of day.
