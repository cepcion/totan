<p class="TaleDestiny">(2095) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>After months of searching you finally pin down the mad captain&rsquo;s location. When you find him, he is drinking alone in the back of a dingy tavern.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;I heard it was the Six-Pointed Star of Wonder that drove you mad,&rdquo; you whisper, leaning in. &ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; The captain&rsquo;s lip quivers and his brow furrows. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not speak of such things in my presence!&rdquo; he spits. &ldquo;Do you hear me? Never!&rdquo; [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Under the pretext of looking for a good sailor to help navigate an especially treacherous stretch of seaway, you engage the mad captain in conversation. After a few mugs of wine you steer the conversation in the direction of antiquities, and from there to talk of the infamous Six-Pointed Star of Wonder. Although the captain refuses to take part in any expedition involving the recovery thereof, he does agree to sell you an old map, but he implores you not to make use of it! [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
