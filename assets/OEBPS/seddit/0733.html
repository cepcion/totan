<p class="TaleDestiny">(733) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You scream in terror as a gout of flame issues from the earth around you. Many people come to your aid at the sound of your cry. Before they arrive, the fire disappears as suddenly as it came, leaving no sign of its presence.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The others disbelieve your story and think are crazy. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Your story is so vivid that the others believe you. They are filled with wonder and awe at the marvels of Allah&rsquo;s creation. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
