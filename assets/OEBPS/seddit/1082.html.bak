<p class="TaleDestiny">(1082) - BEGUILING, WOUNDED (M), CRIPPLED (M)</p>
<p>You see a sage mount an ebony horse-statue and rise into the air upon it. You covet the statue and find an arch rival of the sage, offering him good payment if he will help. Together you sneak into the sage&rsquo;s yard.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your companion quickly discerns the flying mechanisms. Together you fly out of the courtyard. Suddenly, he pushes you off and flies away. You are fortunate; a rocky cliff breaks your fall. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: The gleam of treachery is in your hired sage&rsquo;s eye. You flatter him into teaching you the mechanisms of the horse; then you mount and fly off, leaving him hurling insults at the soles of your feet.
[D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / Ebony Horse]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WOUNDED, CRIPPLED  (All mandatory)</span>: You and your companion examine the horse, discerning at length the mechanism of its use. Abruptly, the sage leaps into the saddle and begins to rise into the air. You leap for the flying statue, but manage to catch only the stirrup.</p>
<p>You cling tightly, but your wounds keep you from using both hands, so the sage is able to kick you free before you are scarcely above the clouds. You fall a long way and have a great deal of time (more than you&rsquo;d like) to examine your life and commit your soul unto Allah before you become the messy object of much speculation amidst the curious people below.
