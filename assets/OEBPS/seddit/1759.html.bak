<p class="TaleDestiny">(1759) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>During a visit to the palace of your dear friend, prince Taj el Mulouk, you find him depressed and distraught. His love for the princess Dunya has been thwarted by her prophetic dreams. You resolve to learn all you can about his situation that you might be able to help him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you are done, you can see no way to aid your unhappy friend through all of the obstacles in his path. But his sorry tale may serve as a warning to others you come to know. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Having made a study of dreams and prophecies, you listen intently as your friend describes every detail of the princess&rsquo;s dream. After consulting your astrological charts and certain almanacs of the ancient Greeks, you return to your friend with an alternate interpretation of the dream, one that you&rsquo;re certain would compel her to open her heart to your friend. [D+1 / S+1 / Seduction]</p>
