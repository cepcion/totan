<p class="TaleDestiny">(1953) - BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You were delighted when you stumbled onto the fabled Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. Now that bit of good fortune just might save your life. The brigands who surround you are not impressed by the few trinkets you carry. They demand something more.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You convince them to let you lead them to the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. Once there, you take advantage of their distraction to slip away. Odds are they will turn on each other as they try to determine what to do with so much wealth! [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</span>: Using all of your wits and cleverness, you turn the bandits against their leader with your tales of the magnificent wealth of the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. Now you won&rsquo;t only have a fortune in ivory, but you&rsquo;ll have bearers to help you carry it! [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
