<p class="TaleDestiny">(2440) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>Across the stream, you see a shadowy horse, but you cannot make out the rider. Something about the beast draws your curiosity, and you try to catch it before it disappears into the night.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you might, you cannot catch the shadowy form, which rides with greater speed than any living thing. You realize that you are chasing a phantom and had best give up before it steals your soul. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You realize that you are chasing a phantom, and you cannot hope to catch it. Rather, you must lie in wait where it will appear the following night. You prepare yourself&mdash;and spring into action when the phantom next appears!</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you have Stealth and Stealing</span>: You catch the phantom unawares and capture it in a large glass bottle! Now you can force the phantom spirit to teach you its secrets. [D+1 / S+1 / Magic]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If not</span>: The phantom notices you long before you can leap for it. To your shock, it turns on you and leaps into your body. Now you find that you cannot control your own limbs! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</li>
