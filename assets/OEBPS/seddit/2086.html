<p class="TaleDestiny">(2086) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>It is said that the captain Tariq has heard a prophecy that one of your name will be his doom, and he has set his men to finding you. They spread out, splitting into teams of two in their search for you. The net is tightening fast and time is running out!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pick out what looks to be the weakest pair of men and wait for the right moment. Getting the drop on them, you knock them both out and make good your escape. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: With no time to spare, you tear off a scrap of your clothing and leave it on an outstretched branch. Then you retrace your steps backwards and head off in another direction. As you hoped, the captain&rsquo;s men pass right by! [D+1 / S+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
