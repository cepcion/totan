<p class="TaleDestiny">(915) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>In your journey, you come to a great lake and hire a man to ferry you across. When you are but halfway across, you see something odd a stone&rsquo;s throw away, and you tell the man to turn towards it that you might follow the ripples on the surface. Suddenly you feel an unholy presence beneath you, and long black arms rise from the water and grasp the ferryman.</p><p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You watch in fear as the man is carried beneath the surface. In shock, you drift helplessly on the lake, but eventually you come to your senses and return to shore. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose Enduring Hardship
(1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Putting down your horror, you seize the ferryman&rsquo;s pole, and guide the craft in pursuit of the man. You come to a small island on the verges of the lake, and watch, disgusted, as a band of gools emerge from the water dragging their hapless victim. Before they can turn to their unholy feast, you fall upon them and destroy them. [D+2 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
