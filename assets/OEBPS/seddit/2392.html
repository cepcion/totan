<p class="TaleDestiny">(2392) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The other is quite fetching and agrees to your kind offer of help. The other, it seems, is plagued by a former lover, and though the other could easily turn the lover into a frog, out of the love they once shared he would rather dissuade her attentions more gently.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You seek out the former lover and convince her that if she continues to importune the other, she will find herself living in a pond. The lover clearly receives the message, and the other gives you a small gift for your troubles. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You show the other how to make himself appear to be suffering from a horrible, disfiguring disease. The other then goes to his former love, who flees in disgust, never to return. For your trouble, the other gives you a token of his esteem. [D+1 / Treasure]</p>
