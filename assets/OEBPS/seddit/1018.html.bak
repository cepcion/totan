<p class="TaleDestiny">(1018) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The Vizier of this land has usurped power while the Sultan is away and has levied a terrible tax on the people.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hide from the tax collector, but a scheming citizen turns you in. You are jailed in addition to the tax. [W-3 (Min: Beggar) / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: When the tax-collector comes to you, you fast-talk him and pay only a few dinars. The tax collector is puzzled, but you leave town before he can figure out what has happened. [D+1 / Beguiling]</p>
