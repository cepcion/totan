<p class="TaleDestiny">(2560) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Through a series of misadventures, you fall into the debt of a pirate captain. He comes to you and demands that you convince a famed swordfighter to join his ship&rsquo;s crew. The warrior will not be easy to convince, and you cannot hope to win through force of arms. The pirate recommends you resort to abduction, but has little more advice to offer. He chuckles as you depart. You despair of completing this task, but you dare not risk the pirate&rsquo;s wrath. You locate the weapon master and plot your approach.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You speak with the fighter, telling the truth and pleading for understanding. You appeal to the other&rsquo;s sense of adventure. The swordfighter scoffs at you, slashes your arm for your temerity, and sends you packing. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: It is clear you cannot take the warrior by force, so instead you rely on guile. You &ldquo;happen&rdquo; upon the fighter and offer to buy drinks in exchange for stories. Through sheer intestinal fortitude, you are able to keep your head when the other drops unconscious. You drag his limp body to the pirate ship and settle your debt. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
