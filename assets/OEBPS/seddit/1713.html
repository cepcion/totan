<p class="TaleDestiny">(1713) - SEAMANSHIP  (M)</p>
<p>In the distance, you spy a tiny island, little more than a pillar of rock. A man stands at the pinnacle waving a large, tattered flag. You decide to sail closer to offer the man assistance. But as you approach, you sense something disturbing the water. The tiny finger of land is being guarded by not one but two of the mighty dendan!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Certainly no ship could approach that land with the enormous fish about. You try to signal the man that there is nothing you can do to help, but an amazing thing happens. Seeing your ship, the man leaps into the water and begins swimming towards you. You are astounded that the dangerous dendan make no effort to stop him. A few minutes later, he is climbing the ropes onto your ship, thanking you for rescuing him before he died of thirst.
