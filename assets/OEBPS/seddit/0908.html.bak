<p class="TaleDestiny">(908) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>As you journey, you spy a poor man leading a scrawny mule, to which he talks vigorously. You can scarcely credit your ears when the mule answers him! Following at a distance, you overhear it say, &ldquo;&hellip;and the prince will surely die tomorrow.&rdquo; The next day the prince dies in an accident. You must find this prophetic mule!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You return to where you first saw them, but can find no trace of it. Those around look at you in disbelief at your inquiries. This great prize has slipped through your fingers! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You make subtle inquiries in the town, being careful not to reveal what you seek. One day soon, you come across them again, and present yourself to them as a wizard from a distant land. The mule is pleased to share his gift with you, and you gain many strange glimpses into the future. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
