<p class="TaleDestiny">(1949) - None</p>
<p>Sitting in the middle of a vast field of elephant bones, you bow your head in prayer to the Most High. After a lengthy meditation, you realize that this too is part of Allah&rsquo;s grand plan. If all of this ivory had been meant for men to own, then the Graveyard would not be so deep in the jungle! With some regret, you turn your back on the wealth of this place and return to the world of men. As you go, your heart grows lighter and lighter. You feel a devotion to Allah stronger than you have ever felt before. [Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
