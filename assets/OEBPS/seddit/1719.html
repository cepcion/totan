<p class="TaleDestiny">(1719) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>After one or two failed attempts, you realize that there are too many guards and they are too skilled for you to overcome them by strength of arms alone. You&rsquo;re going to have to be more creative if you are ever going to see the inside of this palace.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Cut crystal walls, you learn, are very sharp and painful to climb. Nonetheless, you press on, scaling the slippery walls to reach a balcony on the third floor. Hopefully no one saw you during your climb. Good thing you remembered to bring your sword with you! [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Using your cunning, you find a part of the palace that cannot be seen by any guards. Using a rope and hook, you are able to sneak into the palace through an open window on the top floor. The wealth of this place is as fabulous as the palace itself! Surely such a wealthy man will not miss a golden item or two? [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
