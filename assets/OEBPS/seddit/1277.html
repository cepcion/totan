<p class="TaleDestiny">(1277) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You climb a tree to observe the rituals. Suddenly, hornets are all about you, stinging fiercely.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You leap down, your observations forgotten. Even in your pain, though, you have the sense to keep silent and are not discovered as you flee. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You endure their stings that you might continue your observations, which reveal the means of protection from druidic sorcery. [D+3 / S+2 / Scholarship / Protective Talisman]</p>
