<p class="TaleDestiny">(2010) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>As you travel one day, you hear a tearing, gnashing sound. You move quietly around some obstacles and spy two gooleh devouring a poor herdsman. In their hunger, the gooleh have dropped their belongings, including a leather satchel. No doubt it was stolen from another victim. You cannot help the youth, but you can exact some retribution.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you attempt to snatch the pack, one of the gooleh hears you. The two spring up and bellow at you. You back away fearfully. The gooleh are unwilling to leave their meal so you are able to escape. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You stealthily remove the satchel from the area&hellip; and find a valuable treasure buried at the bottom. When you arrive at a nearby town, you report the shepherd&rsquo;s demise to authorities. [D+1 / S+1 / Magic Bead]</p>
