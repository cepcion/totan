<p>The other&rsquo;s wretched condition cannot help but stir you to compassion.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your offer of conversation is ignored but your offer of coin is gratefully accepted by the other. However, from the greed in his eyes and the way he snatches the coins before hurrying off, you know he will not have his new wealth for long. The lesson is not lost on you. [D+2 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">RESPECTED  (mandatory):</span> Your caring for the other is observed. The witnesses are moved by your example, and they rush to aid the other as well. With very few coins leaving your purse, the other is restored to a respectable status. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
