<p class="TaleDestiny">(526) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION  (M), BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>The other whispers to you of the love a young noble bears for you. The other says his patron begs you for a rendezvous, and you go to the place that he names. But when you arrive, the windows and doors are dark and barred.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have been made to play the fool. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION  (mandatory):</span> Thinking your lover coy and eager to be wooed, you stand in the street and intone honeyed verses sure to win your beloved&rsquo;s heart. Suddenly the shutters open and an ancient creature of indeterminate sex gazes out at you with love. The shrill laughter of her neighbors rings out at you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You realize that the messenger made a fool of you. You return to him and punish him for his impertinence. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
