<p class="TaleDestiny">(1629) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You meet the other in the market, and by subtle words encourage him to go to a remote place where you will be able to accomplish what you must. However, the other gets ahead of you, and when you catch up, he is surrounded by a pride of lions! If you do not act, he will surely be torn to shreds by their claws and fangs. You grab the biggest, heaviest rock that you can find and throw it at the lions. Unfortunately, you miss and strike the other in the head.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The lions momentarily stop to try to find you, but quickly return to their meal. The gruesome scene is forever burned into your memory, as you can&rsquo;t help but wonder what would have happened if you had never come along and tried to help. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You manage to attract the attention of the lions in the process, but stay hidden so that they pass on. When the lions have moved a sufficient distance away, you jump down and recover the unconscious form. When he comes to, he thanks you profusely for saving his life&hellip; but can&rsquo;t seem to remember where the bruise on his head came from&hellip; [D+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
