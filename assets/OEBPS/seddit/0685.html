<p class="TaleDestiny">(685) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You watch the fire, and suddenly from a dark alley behind you a voice whispers, &ldquo;Oh, most beautiful, is it not?&rdquo; You see an old man wearing a red turban, gazing at the fire with a mad gleam in his eye.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You recoil in distaste and move quickly away from the lunatic.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You recognize the red turban, the sign of the evil fire-worshipping Magian! Why, the cur has probably set the fire himself! You set upon the heathen dog and beat him, then drag him before the Sultan, who showers you with honors for this deed. [D+2 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
