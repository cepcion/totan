<p class="TaleDestiny">(1439) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You prepare a little entertainment with some accomplices, and your scheme is successful. However, in spite of his great power, your victim professes to be unable to help you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Sadly, you let him go on his way. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You realize that your victim is sorely lacking in intelligence, and you interrogate him cleverly. Eventually, he remembers a huge pile of gold he once saw, and brings it to you, believing that you are an agent of the Caliph. [D+2 / W+2 (Max: RiCh) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
