<p class="TaleDestiny">(1982) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You have learned of the existence of a Magian cult operating from a nearby dormant volcano. According to tales you have heard, they plan to awaken the volcano by making blasphemous human sacrifices.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You approach the Vizier, but he refuses to act on your information. When the volcano later erupts, he knows that you could blame him for not acting on your wise advice, so he has you cast into the dungeons. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You approach the court openly and tell all present of what you have learned, reminding them of many tales of those who did not heed honest warnings. They nod at your wisdom, and the Sultan commands his army to patrol the volcano. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
