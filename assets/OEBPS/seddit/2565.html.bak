<p class="TaleDestiny">(2565) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Walking through a dusty village, you overhear a woman berating her daughter about her lack of a profession. The harassed maiden yelps in protest as she is tossed into the street to land at your feet in an ignoble heap. Dejected, she looks up at you&hellip; and Allah inspires you to take pity. Extending your hand, you say gently, &ldquo;If you would like a job, perhaps I can provide. It may not be the kind of profession your mother imagined, but it might serve you well.&rdquo; With nowhere to go, the other nods compliantly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Everyone needs a good camel handler, and the other proves to be better than average. For the next leg of your travel, your camel never seems to tire or become irate. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You swing the other onto your camel and begin to ride to the local inn, where the other is  to act as your valet. Behind you, the sounds of shouting make it clear that others might want to speak to your new charge. It turns out that her leaving the village was construed by the constabulary as fleeing, as the young woman was a con artist whose previous professions had led her to hide in her mother&rsquo;s home. As you spur your mount out of town, you think, &ldquo;This is what I get for acting hastily&hellip; but maybe she can teach me a few tricks for my troubles.&rdquo; [S+1 / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (SOLDIER)]</p>
