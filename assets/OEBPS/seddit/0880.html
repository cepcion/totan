<p class="TaleDestiny">(880) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>In your lodging, a strange voice whispers your name.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Suspecting evil, you leap from bed, shouting and laying about with your sword. Others come to your aid but are irritated by your silly tale, for there is no sign of wrongdoing nor indeed anything untoward. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: The peace you feel at the sound of the voices tells you they mean no harm. Wisely, you await the morning, and the crowing of the rooster drives the voices away. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
