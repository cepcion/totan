<p class="TaleDestiny">(1777) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You had to do it. Your host told you that you could open any door except the hundredth. But spurred by curiosity, you had to open the last door and free the imprisoned &rsquo;efreet, who even now is rampaging through the palace destroying everything.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Against the might of the &rsquo;efreet, there is naught you can do but pray for forgiveness. You&rsquo;ll do that as soon as you get to a safer place. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Praying that Allah will protect you, you taunt the
&rsquo;efreet until he chases you. Running into the forbidden room, you hide behind the door. The raging &rsquo;efreet charges into the chamber in search of you. With a laugh, you dive out of the room, pulling the door closed behind you. The walls shake with the protests of the re-imprisoned
&rsquo;efreet. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
