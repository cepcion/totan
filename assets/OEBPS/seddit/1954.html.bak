<p class="TaleDestiny">(1954) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You overhear a drunkard claim to have discovered the mythical Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. No one else believes his tale, but to your ear the story has a ring of truth. You decide to buy him another drink.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After spending the bulk of the day plying the old man with liquor, you finally convince him to tell you the location of the Graveyard. But when you try to follow his directions, spilled out with drunken certainty and equally drunken accuracy, you find yourself somewhere in the middle of the wilderness. Only Allah can find you!
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You quickly determine that if the old man did truly discover such a miraculous find, he has no idea where it is anymore. You cut your losses and continue on your way. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
