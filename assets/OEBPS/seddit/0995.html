<p class="TaleDestiny">(995) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You witness a young neâ€˜er-do-well cheat an old man at dice. As the young thief moves off, you resolve to rob him and return the money.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The scoundrel is a tough customer, but Allah aids your cause. You overcome him, gain back the coins, and return them to the old man. [D+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You catch the con-man by surprise and knock him out. When you hold the coins in your hand, however, your resolve to return the money dwindles, and you add them to your own purse, not mindful of the needs of the old man. [D-1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Lose Piety]</p>
