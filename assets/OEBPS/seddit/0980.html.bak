<p>The old man&rsquo;s clothing betrays him as wealthy, and there is no one else about.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may rob him or follow him:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you follow him</span>: [Go to paragraph <a href="1381.html#TaleHeader">1381</a>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you rob him</span>:</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You leap forward, expecting little resistance. The old man whirls and utters a cry, and you are thrown back by magical forces. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</li>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: As you move forward to rob the man, you espy a symbol on his turban which reveals him to be a sorcerer. You challenge the infidel, secure in your mastery of the arts arcane. He turns, a snarl on his misshapen face, as you unleash your most devastating magics upon him. A brief wind seems to stir his cloak as your spells strike him, and then he smiles and raises his hands, fingers crooked in gestures unfamiliar to you. You feel yourself dwindling and shrinking, each stage of the transformation a fresh agony, until you have become a pomegranate. The sorcerer gestures again, and you explode into a thousand pips, scattered about his feet. Some part of you is aware of your foe himself beginning to transform. At last he becomes a large chicken which pecks up each fragment of your being. As the last pip&mdash;the part with your soul&mdash;is eaten, you cease to be. [Death]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP  (mandatory):</span> You recognize the symbol on his turban as denoting a powerful enchanter. You prepare your own counter-charms, grinning and looking forward to this contest of equals. When the smoke clears and the earth settles, you are victorious, and you take from him a most valuable item. [D+2 / Treasure]</li>
