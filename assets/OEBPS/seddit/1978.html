<p class="TaleDestiny">(1978) - BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You find yourself trapped on a volcanic island, and the earth is starting to rumble! Having little other option, you decide to explore and find a large cave. Inside the cave you find a giant efreet, sheathed in fire and shackled in chains of gold!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hope that the eruption will end if the &lsquo;efreet is freed, so you shatter the chains. In hindsight, you shouldn&rsquo;t have expected gratitude from such a creature! Now it is you who is in chains. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</span>: You know that &lsquo;efreet cannot be trusted, so you force him to agree to a deal in exchange for his freedom before you sever his chains. Fortunately, he is true to his word and delivers you from the island once you have released him. [D+1 / S+1 / Move up to three spaces in any direction]</p>
