<p class="TaleDestiny">(566) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The other is curt, offended by your curiosity.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;What call do you have to meddle in the affairs of others?&rdquo; he I asks, and strides away indignantly. [S+1] </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You buy the other a drink to make amends, and to loosen his tongue. You learn that he is on a quest for the fabled Circle of Stones and has a map which will lead him to it. You are offered a place in the quest in exchange for your silence. [D+2 / Opportunity to enter Stonehenge]</p>
