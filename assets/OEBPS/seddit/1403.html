<p class="TaleDestiny">(1403) - FATED  (M),  LUCK</p>
<p>The ring comes easily off the finger of the skeleton, and you hasten away to examine your prize.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you leave the island, the sound of a tempest fills your ears, and the waves rush forward to cover the tomb. The ring vanishes from your hands, drawn to its true owner under the sea. As the island sinks, you are caught in a giant wave which buffets you senseless. You awaken on a distant shore, with few of your possessions. [D+1 / S+1 / W-3 (Min: Beggar) / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED  (mandatory),  LUCK</span>: When you place the ring upon your finger, an enormous &rsquo;efreet appears. &ldquo;I am your slave, O Solomon; what is your wish?&rdquo; [D+2 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Fabulous) / Magic / Move to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
