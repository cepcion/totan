<p class="TaleDestiny">(2438) - WILDERNESS LORE, MAGIC</p>
<p>With a shudder you awaken in the night to see the dim hazy outline of a great horse passing through your camp. You realize that you can see right through the beast!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to rope the horse, but your line passes through it without meeting any resistance. Terrified, you burrow deeper into your blankets and pray for morning to come. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Watching the animal, you see that it does not touch the ground or leave any tracks. It is a ghost! You cannot capture such a beast by mortal means. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You realize quickly that this is no mortal creature, but a specter! You essay an enchantment to capture it.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding two for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Magic at Master level</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;10: The shimmering image vanishes before you can complete your spell. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">11+: You chant the forbidden words of binding, and the beast is surrounded by a blue light. Quickly, you unravel the history of the ghost and realize that it was the mount of a great Sultan who was slain near here. The ghost leads you to the lost cairn, from which you recover a long-lost treasure. [D+1 / Treasure]</li>
