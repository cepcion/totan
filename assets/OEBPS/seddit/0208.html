<p class="TaleDestiny">(208) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>No sooner have you opened your mouth but words begin to pour from the other in an unstoppable torrent. &ldquo;Oh yes, well let me tell you this tale I heard from a fisherman&hellip; or maybe it was a slave. Anyway&hellip;&rdquo; The other speaks incessantly for hours, without pause for food or rest.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although a tale or two would be interesting, this verbal assault drives you mad. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You sit with a semblance of rapt attention throughout the interminable blathering. Your host is immensely pleased by your receptiveness, and when finally he is finished, he presents you with a great treasure, saying, &ldquo;I have been so lonely. You are the first to stay and listen in such a long time.&rdquo; You gladly take the gift as due payment for your suffering and go on your way. [D+2 / S+2 / Courtly Graces / Treasure]</p>
