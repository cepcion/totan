<p class="TaleDestiny">(971) - PIETY</p>
<p>Vicious Bedouin raiders have come upon you as you make ready for sleep. Off into the forest you dash, praying to Allah for intervention.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Bedouins catch you easily. Your pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears, though they merely rob you, when easily they might have slain you. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: One brigand is stung by a bee and rides away howling in pain; a second tumbles from his mount and knocks himself unconscious. The third and fourth get into a terrible argument: one flees and the other rides off in hot pursuit. Truly Allah&rsquo;s ways are subtle and great! [D+2 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
