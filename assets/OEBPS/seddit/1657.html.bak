<p>The other desires to sell you a large, leather-bound, ancient tome of mysteries. The other will not allow you to open the book, but you are impressed by the embossed leather cover, cracked with age. You haggle half the day for a lower price and the other eventually accepts half of the original offer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You purchase the book and the other disappears down a dark alley. You realize; too late; that the book is no more than an old accounting book, disguised as something more. The pages are blank. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You become suspicious about the other&rsquo;s willingness to significantly reduce the price. Examining the book more carefully, you realize that it is actually a fake. [S+2]</p>
