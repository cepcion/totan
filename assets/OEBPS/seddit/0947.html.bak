<p class="TaleDestiny">(947) - STEALTH AND STEALING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You see a most remarkable creature&mdash;a beast with the head and wings of an eagle but the body of a lion! It swoops down on a nearby field and seizes up a sheep before flying off. You give chase, eager to learn more of this strange vision.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The creature sees you giving chase, and drops the sheep upon you. You limp back to the shepherd and tell him all you have seen. He thanks you for your help and dresses your cracked ribs before you depart. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You follow the griffin but manage to stay out of its sight, and come at last to its aerie. The bones of hundreds of stolen sheep litter the ground. You wait until the creature slumbers and slay it, carrying its body back to the shepherds. They reward you handsomely for your brave deed. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You follow the griffin for many miles until it alights and settles down to slumber. You stealthily approach the creature and throw the Golden Bridle over its head. When it awakens, it is as docile as a gelding horse and you ride it into the sky. [D+2 / S+2 / Stealth and Stealing / Move to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
