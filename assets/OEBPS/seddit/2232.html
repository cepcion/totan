<p class="TaleDestiny">(2232) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You cannot help but be moved by the other&rsquo;s tale of the woes that lead him to his current situation.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is stirred by your compassion and swears by Allah that he will not squander your kindness. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Truly it is said, &ldquo;Alms now are a meal now, but true wisdom is a meal forever.&rdquo; The other heeds your wise words and follows your guidance. In short order, his situation is put to rights and he is once again on the road to self-sufficiency. For the rest of his days he vows to assist you where he may. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
