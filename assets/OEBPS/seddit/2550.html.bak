<p class="TaleDestiny">(2550) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>While walking in a small market, you notice the other. Something in the other&rsquo;s behavior catches your attention and you realize the other is not what he seems, but is a villain in disguise. You sneak up close to the other, holding your sword to his back, and draw him down a dark alleyway. He smiles and pushes open his cloak, revealing leather armor and a pair of daggers. You look up and see several large men in the alley.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;You played your part perfectly,&rdquo; she mocks. &ldquo;I am continually amazed by the stupidity of would-be kidnappers.&rdquo; The men hold you as she relieves you of your belongings. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You spring aside and spin your sword through a series of complex motions. Your movements are flawless and impressive. One of the men pales. &ldquo;We have bearded a sword master. Let us flee before he carves us like baked sheep.&rdquo; After they depart, you inform the local magistrate of the scam and are rewarded.
