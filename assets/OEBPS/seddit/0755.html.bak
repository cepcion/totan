<p>The howling wind drives bits of sand into your eyes. You can hardly draw breath or speak.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You choke on the driving sands. As darkness falls you still are buffeted by the sand. When dawn comes, you are amazed to discover that you still live, for your pains are too great for you to be in paradise, yet less than the torment of the damned. You struggle to your feet and discover that in the storm, you wandered far from your path, but what greets your eyes is a wondrous sight! [D+1 / Move to the <a href="0177.html#TaleHeader">City of Brass</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You realize that the gravest danger is from suffocating on the sand, and carefully cover your mouth and nose with cloth. You stumble on, and finally the storm passes. Lo! There is another unfortunate traveler half-buried in the sand. You pull him out, and he praises you to the One God for delivering him from certain death! [D+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
