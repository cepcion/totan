<p class="TaleDestiny">(1861) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You will need help if you are going to overcome the menacing other. You recruit a couple of rowdies in a nearby tavern.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other sees you approach and decides that the odds are against him. Before you can react, he flees into a darkened alley. Your &ldquo;allies&rdquo; lose heart at sight of the darkness, and you are left empty-handed. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Dangerous prey like the other requires caution. Using tactics you learned when hunting tigers, you instruct your allies well. The other is surrounded and quickly overcome. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
