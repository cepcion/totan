<p class="TaleDestiny">(1765) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>Even bold heroes like yourself can be laid low by sickness. As you pass near the Islands of Camphor, you fall prey to a nasty cough that will not let you rest. As you pray for health, you remember a lesson taught to you by a woodsman many years ago. The bark of the camphor laurel can be boiled to produce a vapor very beneficial to breathing. You wish to obtain some.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Rumors of your illness spread through the islands like wildfire. Fearful that you may bear some manner of plague, the Sultan orders you expelled from his lands before you can infect others. [D-1 / Enduring Hardship / Have another player move you exactly two spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: From the deck, you instruct your fellow sailors where to land to best find the trees and retrieve the precious medicine without disturbing the sometimes hostile natives. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
