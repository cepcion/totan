<p class="TaleDestiny">(1987) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>A pack of wild dogs blocks your path as you make your way across the Valley of Dogs. They are too many for your lone sword to handle, so you have to find a way to distract them while you make your escape. Perhaps there&rsquo;s something they want to eat even more than you?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try backing up along the path, to buy some time, but alas! More of the pack has snuck up behind you while you were focused on the group in front. Now you&rsquo;re in a very bad position. You are lucky that some passing animal distracts them before they finish you off. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You still have some meat from a gazelle you killed shortly before entering the valley It&rsquo;s rather dry, but it might be enough to attract their attention. You toss the haunch over the side of the path, and the starving beasts fall to fighting over it, leaving you in peace. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
