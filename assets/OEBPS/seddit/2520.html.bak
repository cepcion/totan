<p class="TaleDestiny">(2520) - PIETY</p>
<p>You are approached on the street by an ancient beggar who smells vaguely of camels and old dates. The scruffy one waves a piece of parchment and says, &ldquo;What would you do for infinite treasure? Would you give me your Koran for such a prize?&rdquo; You hand over your book and watch as the vagrant stuffs it into a sack and walks away, whistling.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You should have known better than to trade your piety for wealth. You wander for days looking for a single landmark on the map, but to no avail. By the time you get back to the village, you are dirty and starving yourself. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You follow the directions on the map carefully, tracing the arcane scribbles to a cave hidden under the sand. Inside, you find not only treasures and wonders, but also the beggar. The other claims to be seeking a trusting and pious soul. Handing you back your Koran, the ancient one also offers you a most remarkable object. [S+2 / Treasure]</p>
