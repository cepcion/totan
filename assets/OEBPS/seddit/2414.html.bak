<p class="TaleDestiny">(2414) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Sitting on a large rock before you is a woman of amazing beauty, crying. You approach and ask how you can be of service. The woman turns to face you and you are immediately struck by the fact that she is not mortal. Yet, you stand by your offer, though you are a bit frightened. The &rsquo;efreeteh tells a tale of her lost love, taken by an evil Sultan to be executed for being in love with a non-mortal.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You don&rsquo;t have the slightest notion of how to deal with a noble personage, evil or not. With many apologies you rescind your offer and go about your way. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You are confident that you can help, but you need her help in looking the part: rich robes, platters full of gold and jewels, a large retinue. With such accoutrements, you not only gain an audience with the Sultan but are able to free the &rsquo;efreeteh&rsquo;s love. As a reward, she leaves behind all of the gifts she created. [S+1 / W+5 (Max: Princely)]</p>
