<p>You are told by many in town that only the other has the knowledge and skill to guide you through the dreaded Ravine of Tears. Reluctantly, you pay his price, hoping that he&rsquo;ll be sober before you reach your destination.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: No sooner do you enter the Ravine than your drunken guide falls from his horse and breaks his skull. Now you are on your own. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Long before you reach the Ravine, you realize that your guide&rsquo;s drunkenness makes him worthless to you. You decide to find your own route. [D+1 / Have another player move you exactly two spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You know that your only hope of success is to force the drunk to get sober. You pour out all of his wine, and listen to his cries and threats for four days. Finally, he thanks you for ridding him of his demons, and he shows you the right path.
