<p class="TaleDestiny">(1049) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You seek to do what is right for the captain of your ship, Kafur. As you speak to him, you notice that he seems far more interested in your fine possessions than in anything you actually say.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give him some of them, which makes him covet the rest all the more. One night you awake with a hand clamped over your mouth; in seconds you are swimming for your life. [W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You suspect Kafur of plotting to throw you overboard. You make yourself look like a fearsome jinni and, when the crewmen enter your cabin, leap forth. They return to Kafur and reveal you as a powerful sorcerer. The rest of the trip passes without incident.
