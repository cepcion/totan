<p class="TaleDestiny">(2576) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You have heard the sorry story of a maiden of this town who is being held hostage against the surrender of her brother, a ruthless bandit leader. Her plight moves you deeply, and you approach the magistrate to allow her to work for you instead of rotting in a dungeon; her wages can go to pay the families of her brother&rsquo;s victims. Moved by your compassion, he agrees.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Within a week, the maiden has escaped and fled to her brother. You are sentenced to serve in her place. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You easily note the maiden testing the limits of her bounds. A week after you take her, she escapes, and you follow her directly to her brother&rsquo;s hiding place. During the night, you help yourself to his ill-gained goods, and then for good measure leave a knife in his chest before you move on to another town. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)]</p>
