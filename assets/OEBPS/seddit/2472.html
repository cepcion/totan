<p>You happen upon the largest flock of birds you could ever imagine&mdash;but these are no ordinary birds. Filled with wonder, you pursue them, hoping to find one who can tell you their secret.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wander for days before the birds fly too far away for you to follow any further. Who will believe such a strange tale? [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You are amazed to find Shaykh Nasr surrounded by the great flock of birds! He tells you that you have found the great Parliament of the Birds, and invites you to explore his palace while he attends to the needs of the birds. [Have an immediate encounter in the <a href="ReactionMatrix-N-Palaceof100Closets.html">Palace of 100 Closets</a> (Matrix N)]</p>
