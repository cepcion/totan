<p>Ducking and scrambling desperately, you avoid the worst of the slide.</p>

<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You are tiring&hellip; but strain yourself far beyond your limits. You collapse, exhausted and befuddled, but you have avoided injury. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
