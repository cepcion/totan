<p class="TaleDestiny">(2539) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Late at night, you arrive in a small village. As you make your way through the dark streets, you notice a young couple hastily climbing out of a window. The man implores you, &ldquo;Please sir, we are young lovers whose families have betrothed us to others. If you call out we will be caught and forced to marry ones we do not love.&rdquo; These two are foolish to ignore the wishes of their elders, but who can fault true love? They depart, but you are soon confronted by two armed men who demand to know if you have seen their children.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stammer for a moment, then feign ignorance. Something in your manner reveals more than you intended, though, and the men hurry off in the same direction as the couple. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You distract the two with a tale of two lovers, destined to be forever separated. The prince, given a fine wife, grew old with many strong sons but remained unhappy even unto his death. The tale of the princess was sadder still, for the loss of her love rendered her barren. Her line died out and their house fell into chaos. The men, entranced by your story, listen for half the night. In the end, they return home, vowing to consider their children&rsquo;s wishes.
