<p class="TaleDestiny">(889) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>As you pass by a well, a strange and terrible voice calls from deep within it, &ldquo;Oh, please lower a rope!&rdquo; With great haste and no little fear, you do as the voice asks. When you draw the rope up, clinging to the end is a loathsome demon!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You scream and bolt in terror, releasing the rope and dropping the creature back to the bottom. You hear his curse clearly as you flee, and know that the creature has set its wrath against you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You do not flinch, but stoically lift the creature from the well, &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; it croaks gratefully. &ldquo;What boon may I give to my benefactor?&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Choice of W+1 (Max: Princely) or You may lose one status of your choice]</p>
