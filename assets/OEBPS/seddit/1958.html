<p class="TaleDestiny">(1958) - WILDERNESS LORE, ENVIOUS  (M)</p>
<p>An ancient and sickly elephant crosses your path. Clearly, it has reached its allotted hour. You realize that it is trying to reach the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard, but it doesn&rsquo;t look as though it has the strength to reach that final resting ground. It seems a tragedy that this noble creature may not be able to achieve the final goal of its life, and you resolve to aid it in any way you can.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you follow the elephant from a comfortable distance, you see the hungry eyes of scavengers watching from the shadows. Taking up your bow, you eye the path suspiciously. When a hyena creeps out of the brush, you let fly an arrow. From the sounds of the fighting, you have provided ample distraction. You continue to protect the elephant from the beasts that would harass it until it finally lies to rest among the bones of its ancestors. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You approach the aged creature. With soothing words and a gentle touch, you earn its trust. You guide it along the safest paths you can find, easing its passage that it might lie among its ancestors. Your soul feels warmed by your act of kindness towards the noble creature. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> You follow the dying elephant for a ways, but your selfish greed overcomes you. Drawing your spear, you slay the unfortunate creature and take its tusks for yourself. The vengeful spirits of the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard rise up and torment you for your terrible act. [D-1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
