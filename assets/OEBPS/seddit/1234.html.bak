<p class="TaleDestiny">(1234) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>A strange beast moves amongst the trees. It has tiny eyes and a huge horn on its nose&mdash;it is a rhinoceros! These creatures can kill elephants! You would love to take it as a trophy, but you must be careful not to draw its attention before you can prepare a trap.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You retreat noisily, and the great beast heads towards you. You leap up a tree to safety, but not before the beast&rsquo;s horn has pinked you in the buttocks. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You quietly trail the beast. Your patience is rewarded a few hours later when the rhino battles an elephant. With the elephant impaled on its horn, the rhino is defenseless; you slay both, taking the elephant&rsquo;s tusks for their ivory. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
