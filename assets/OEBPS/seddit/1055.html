<p class="TaleDestiny">(1055) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>The captain, Aziz, comes to you, sweating and wringing his hands. &ldquo;I have heard tales,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;of rocs in this area that drop stones on passing ships. I fear for our lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You describe a ruse which may save you. He orders the crew to cover the ship with shiny black tarpaulin. From above, ship looks like the back of a huge dendan. Rocs come, but do not bother you. Aziz is quite grateful. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
