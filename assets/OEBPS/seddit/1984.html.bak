<p class="TaleDestiny">(1984) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>For days, the volcano has rumbled and complained. The locals have turned to a Magian cult, who promises to quiet the restless mountain with a sacrifice.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Trusting to your faith and arms, you agree to go with the cultists as their sacrifice. As their captive, you obediently approach the flames of the volcano, but at the last moment, you spring to attack! Though you are badly wounded during your escape, you are content that Allah is pleased with your choice, as the volcano soon goes silent again. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: Bravely, you stand before the people of the village to warn them of the dangers they will face by working with the vile cultists. The simple folk cannot bring themselves to doubt one with such princely airs and demeanor, and under your leadership they turn on the Magians. Perhaps it is coincidence that the volcano soon grows quiet. Then again, maybe the Magians have some power over fire after all&hellip;
