<p class="TaleDestiny">(1976) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Traveling by merchant ship isn&rsquo;t always comfortable, but usually it is safe. So when you notice a smoking mountain atop an island directly in the path of the ship&rsquo;s heading, you immediately approach the captain to warn him away from it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The lure of profit is too much for this captain to ignore. Despite the dangers, he intends to sail as close to the volcano as possible. You are finally able to convince him to take a safer course, but only when you agree to cover his lost profits. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: By appealing to the captain&rsquo;s pride through flowery words and courtly phrases, you are able to convince him to take a somewhat safer route. To ease his loses, you also agree to help him negotiate with the merchants at his final destination. [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
