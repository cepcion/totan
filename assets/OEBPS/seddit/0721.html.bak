<p class="TaleDestiny">(721) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Fingering a bauble around his neck, the other approaches you. &ldquo;Will you assist me in a very lucrative adventure?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pass by the other without another thought. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: As you pass by the other, you can&rsquo;t help looking at his bauble, trying to determine its value. Next thing you know, you awaken in an unfamiliar area, with a heavy purse lying next to you. Apparently, the adventure was very lucrative&mdash;too bad you don&rsquo;t know what kind of adventure it was. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Have another player move you three spaces in any direction]</p>
