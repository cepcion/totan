<p class="TaleDestiny">(2264) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>A chatterbox is never desirable&mdash;but certainly not on a long voyage. You sail and sail with this busybody and not a one of the crew is happy about it. All are of agreement that he must be punished.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You recommend that he walk the plank, and all readily concur. Yet in the morning he&rsquo;s at the breakfast table again&mdash;still gabbing continually. Apparently he&rsquo;s a good swimmer. [S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: He is put in the crow&rsquo;s nest for the rest of the voyage, through storm and blistering heat. He tries to strike up conversations with the segulls, but they soon abandon him as well. He eventually learns his lesson. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
