<p class="TaleDestiny">(2018) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You are surprised when a melancholy gooleh drags herself from a copse of woods and begs you to give yourself to her hunger. She seems so dispirited and pathetic that you cannot help but laugh. You draw your sword.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The beast has more resources than you thought. You are able to hold off her attacks, but she is relentless. Once she slashes you a couple times with her grime-encrusted claws, you decide this game is not for you. You run. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The fight is more serious than you guessed. The gooleh keeps coming despite your best efforts. In the end, it becomes a battle of endurance, but you outlast her and run her through. [D+2 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
