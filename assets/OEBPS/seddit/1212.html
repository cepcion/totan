<p class="TaleDestiny">(1212) - MAGIC, BRASS BOW, INSANE  (M)</p>
<p>Your love has disappeared while traveling near the dreaded magnetic mountain. You set out to the rescue.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your loved one is pinned to the mountainside. You cannot approach or you may become trapped yourself. Fortunately, another is braver than you, and essays the rescue, but the story of your cowardice is in every ear. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You cannot end the threat of the mountain forever, but you can rescue your beloved, which you do. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if not Married)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory):</span> You rush to the assistance of your loved one, unable to bear the sight of her stuck to the face of the mountain like a fly in amber. Alas, your concern, though well-founded, blinds you to the obvious, and soon, you too are trapped beside your beloved. You and she take many days to finally expire from thirst, mere inches other, but unable even to touch, so tightly are you both held by the accursed mountain. [Death]</p>
