<p>The other cackles at your offer. &ldquo;You would intend to aid me? You are an insignificant grain of sand. What could you possibly offer me?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you might, you can find nothing the other wants. In return for your presumption, the other curses you in a thousand tongues too harsh to hear. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You have nothing to offer the other except all the stories that you have heard throughout your adventures. While the other is quite powerful, he often is bored, and forces you into his service to entertain him. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> You can think of nothing that you might have that the other might want. Scowling, the other vanishes with a snap of his fingers. You feel the leaden tablet in your pocket smolder briefly, then cool. From what ill fate has it protected you this time? [D+1]</p>
