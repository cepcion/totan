<p class="TaleDestiny">(2323) - STORYTELLING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>When the robed other passes by, you bump into him, your hand darting into his robes. As you try to remove your hand, you realize it is stuck in a thick liquid, like watered honey. &ldquo;Aha! You&rsquo;ve been snared by my ingenious anti-pickpocket device. Now you shall pay for your transgression.&rdquo; The other tries to cast a spell, but the substance holding you causes the both of you to be entangled in an awkward position.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Passersby laugh at the spectacle of the &ldquo;two-headed&rdquo; fool.
[<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You make the best of the situation and begin performing a dumb-show for the people passing by. Some even throw coins for your performance, which, alas, you must share with your &ldquo;partner.&rdquo; Still, you manage to turn a small profit before you can extricate your hand and flee.
