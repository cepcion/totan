<p class="TaleDestiny">(1794) - BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Seeking shelter from a storm, you dash into the black and red pavilion. You instantly realize that you have made a mistake, as within you find a huge black giant and his cage full of men. You know you had better think fast if you don&rsquo;t want to be the cannibal&rsquo;s next meal.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Acting like you have nothing to fear, you boldly take a seat opposite the giant and ask if he has enough food to share for a weary traveler. He is so shocked by your demeanor that he can barely speak. You berate him for his poor manners as a host, and announce that you will seek shelter from the storm elsewhere. By the time he recovers from his astonishment, you are long gone. [S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</span>: You take advantage of the giant&rsquo;s surprise to offer him an exchange. You convince him that you have some magic gems that will draw more men to his pavilion, but that they will work only as long as you live. The slow-witted fool agrees to allow you and the men in the cave to leave in exchange for your &ldquo;magic&rdquo; gems. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
