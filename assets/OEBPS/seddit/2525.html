<p class="TaleDestiny">(2525) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>Cresting a hill far from any town or village, you see the other sitting on a stone. The other has been lost for many days, and wonders if you can help. The other can offer only the stories of his adventures as repayment. You sit and listen.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other&rsquo;s tales are wondrous and strange. They are more than adequate to compensate you for your help guiding him back to civilization. [S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The stories told are so compelling, you must write them down and fill an entire volume with them. You realize that the tales are more than just stories; they are accounts of the other&rsquo;s life. You decide to seek out some of the wonders the ancient one described. You vow to share any treasures that you find with the raconteur. [S+2 / Draw two Treasures; keep one, discard one]</p>
