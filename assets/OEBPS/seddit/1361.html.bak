<p class="TaleDestiny">(1361) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>In the land under the sea, you see vast cities, great wealth, and huge palaces. Finally, a year and a day later, your tour is complete. You go back to the upper world and tell people all you have seen.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You saw so much that your stories tumble out without sense or detail. Many who hear you are convinced that you are lying. In time, your own stories are repeated back to you by others who have claimed them as their own, and you learn from their tellings. [D+2 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You relate your experiences in the form of fabulous stories, and gain much fame for being a great tale-teller. Only you know that your journey actually took place. [D+2 / S+2 / Seamanship]</p>
