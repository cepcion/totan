<p class="TaleDestiny">(1155) - STORYTELLING, COURTLY GRACES, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>A large door, guarding a secret treasure chamber, stands before you. The key to opening it is contained in the arcane writings covering the door, so you have brought a wise man who reads the ancient language. You have kept him blindfolded so that he would not learn the chamber&rsquo;s location.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The old one opens the door, revealing a huge chamber filled with gold! You leave the man to fetch a mule, but when you return, you find that the old man counted his footsteps, retraced his route, and emptied the chamber. [<span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, COURTLY GRACES, QUICK THINKING</span>: Not only did you blindfold him, but you chattered constantly while walking so that he could not memorize the route. You make a fortune. [D+3 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
