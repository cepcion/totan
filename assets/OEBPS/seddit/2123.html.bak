<p>You charge, weapon drawn, and the other is slain. Others of his kind have witnessed this insensible action.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You instantly regret your action and ask the merfolk what amends can be made. They tell you to await an answer as they discuss. You sit and wait for a day&hellip; then two days&hellip; then a third. You wait until you nearly collapse from hunger. Finally, the others arrive and, seeing you in your state of near death, say that amends have been made. [D+2 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory):</span> You strike down all the merfolk you find in the area, even though not a one has caused or wished you harm. In response, an army of merfolk arise out of the water and start slaughtering all land-dwellers they find. Then you are spotted. &ldquo;There is the murderer of our prince!&rdquo; You are surrounded by merfolk who pierce, spear, and slice you to pieces. As your life flows out of your body from hundreds of wounds, your wits return to you and you feel that this death, alas, is well-deserved. [Death]</p>
