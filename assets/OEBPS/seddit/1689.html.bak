<p class="TaleDestiny">(1689) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The sea itself seems to be upset, churning and rising to abnormal levels. As you try to discern the patterns in the currents, a great jinni bursts out of the water before you, bellowing in rage. It wrestles with a dendan as vast as an entire island!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You can see that the jinni is losing, and you order the sailors to fire flaming arrows into the monster. But the mighty struggle kicks up great waves which swamp your boat and send you overboard. You cast upon a faraway island. [S+2 / Have another player move you to any island space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Without hesitation, you cry out in your loudest voice. The lore of the sea has served you well&mdash;the very instant that the dendan hears your cry, it perishes. The jinni laughs in triumph and skates away across the ocean. You quickly set to rendering the body of the fallen monster. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Dendan Oil]</p></body>
