<p>While carousing with a band of brigands one evening, it slowly dawns on you that they plan to engage in a raid on a passing merchant caravan the following morning.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You spend the bulk of the night in prayer, forgoing sleep in the hope that Allah will hear your plea. You pray for the brigands to see the error of their ways, but come morning they ride off to raid the caravan just the same. [S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Once you realize what the brigands are planning, you decide to keep them up talking, plying them with more and more wine throughout the night. Most are so drunk by the time they fall asleep, the gang as a whole is terribly late to rise the next morning. As a result, the brigands miss their chance to intercept the merchant caravan. Without ever lifting a finger, you have thwarted the brigands&rsquo; raid! [D+1 / S+2 / Beguiling]</p>
