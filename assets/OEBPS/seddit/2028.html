<p class="TaleDestiny">(2028) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You have followed a decrepit figure through sand and brush and see him halt at the edge of a large copse of trees. When the figure waves his hand and calls out a nonsensical word, the trees part to reveal an old city whose streets are paved with gold! As you gaze at the marvel, you suddenly realize you are alone.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Quickly the trees come together, blocking your view&mdash;and your entrance. Unfortunately, you cannot remember the word to open the doorway and you depart, haunted by visions of wealth unattainable.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The trees soon come together, but your sharp mind, used to reading ancient script, has grabbed hold of the word used to part the trees. You now have access to a trove of treasure and knowledge. [D+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Wisdom]</p>
