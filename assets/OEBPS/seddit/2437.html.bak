<p class="TaleDestiny">(2437) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Never before have you seen such a creature as the one flying about the crest of a nearby mountain. Surely the Sultan would be pleased to add such a fabulous creature to his menagerie!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You decide to lure the creature to the ground by staking some livestock where it will be easy to find. The winged creature soon swoops down to take the poor animal, but cannot tear it free from the ropes. Casting a net about it, you soon capture the beast&hellip; to the delight and amusement of the Sultan. [S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The beast is attracted to the lure you set out, but at the last moment it gazes upon you and forgets the tasty meal you have set out. Landing at your feet, it rests its head on your knee, entranced by your beauty. Acting on impulse, you climb onto the creatures back, and it happily flies you many leagues. [D+1 / S+1 / Move up to five spaces in any direction]</p>
