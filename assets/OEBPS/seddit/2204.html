<p class="TaleDestiny">(2204) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are unable to penetrate the wall of guards surrounding your intended victim. The only person who seems to have personal access to the other is an old woman, the other&rsquo;s personal soothsayer. The other, always in fear of losing his fortune, needs his future foretold constantly, as a way of reassurance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It&rsquo;s an interesting bit of information, but not one you can make use of. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: This gives you an idea. You follow the old woman for a week, studying her mannerisms. One evening you knock her out, then dress in her clothes and make yourself up to look like her. When you go to see the other, you tell him that he will find a hidden fortune at a place near the city, but only if he goes there alone at dusk. The other follows your &ldquo;prophecy,&rdquo; and you are there waiting for him.
