<p class="TaleDestiny">(1897) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You have heard of an old sailor, near to death, who has traveled in the regions you are seeking. You hope to hire him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You convince the other to join you on your voyage despite his failing health. Unfortunately, even a few miles on the road proves too much for him. You build a fine cairn to mark his passing. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You don&rsquo;t think the other could survive the trials of a sea voyage in his condition, so you agree to buy all of his old charts and maps. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Seamanship]</p>
