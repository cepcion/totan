<p>Surely it is mercy to end the misery of a wretch like the other. He soon would have died even if you hadn&rsquo;t hastened the end with your blade.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The townsfolk don&rsquo;t seem to agree with you. They accuse you of murder. Rather than rot in the Sultan&rsquo;s dungeons, you flee into the countryside. [S+1 / Have another player move you one space in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: The Sultan dislikes your callous execution. Though you are unable to justify your act to him, you are able to negotiate enough compensation to avoid the dungeon. [S+1 / W-1
(Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The locals are aghast at your actions. But to their minds someone with your angelic features could not truly be guilty of murder. Though they avoid you, no one seeks to punish you. [D+1 / Beguiling]</p>
