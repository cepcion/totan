<p class="TaleDestiny">(464) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, BEGUILING, BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>After you have finished beating the other, he appears humbled, but you later discover him using your punishment to earn pity, as he continues to beg from the crowd.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: This enrages you, and you beat him again (which only enriches him further). The crowds mock you for your foolishness. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, BEGUILING</span>: You recognize the shrewdness of the other in turning adversity to advantage. You are generous with the other, who becomes your devoted companion, ever-ready with a clever plan to help you. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You draw forth the Brass Trumpet, and its blast convinces the crowds that the other is truly wicked, and they turn away from the other. Justice is served. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
