<p class="TaleDestiny">(2012) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You happen upon a camp of a flesh-eating ogre and ogress. The two are huddled in their ragged cloaks and seem distraught. More curious than fearful, you approach to eavesdrop on their conversation. They bemoan a debilitating hunger that has left them despairing and weak. Sprinting through their camp, you snatch several of their belongings and rush off into the countryside. Your daring enrages the desolate fiends, and they give chase.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stay ahead of the beasts, but just barely. After a long and tiring hike, you duck into the next settlement you reach. It is clear that the gool and gooleh know where you are hiding. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: In the end, your mastery of terrain leaves the beasts thrashing futilely in your wake. You learn a thing or two about evasion and caution during the long chase. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
