<p class="TaleDestiny">(353) - WEAPON USE, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the other says excitedly, &ldquo;I can indeed use your aid. I have no need for money, but, for the enchantment I am attempting, I need a quantity of blood&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Without warning he leaps forward, gashes your arm, takes some blood, and throws you out a window. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You defend yourself as he attacks you and tries to take your blood. He desists only after losing a large portion of his own. After he lies dead at your feet, you find some interesting items. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You agree to give him what he seeks, but you casually mention that you have a serious and terrible sickness of the blood that may make yours less useful. The other leaves in haste, and you compliment yourself for your cleverness. [D+1 / S+2 / Beguiling]</p>
