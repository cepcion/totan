<p class="TaleDestiny">(1721) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>Gazing up at the enormous palace of cut crystal, you are shocked to see a young boy looking down at you from behind the golden bars of a gilded cage. Your heart reaches out to him, and you swear an oath that you will aid him in some way.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Traveling to a nearby village, you hope to find someone who is familiar with the palace and grounds. You discover an old soothsayer, who cackles with uncontained glee when you tell him your tale. Casting a fistful of bones in the dirt, he grins a toothless grin and warns you of the dire consequences you will face if you try to enter the palace. Discouraged, you leave to seek another answer. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You remember a tale of a hermit who made his home on a nearby island, whose knowledge of the mystical arts was far beyond that of most men. Hiring a small boat, you make your way to the hermit&rsquo;s island and convince him to help you overcome the guards and rescue the boy.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Magic</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Scholarship</span>:</p>

<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: The hermit teaches you some little tricks, which you use to help you enter the palace. Once inside, you are able to convince the boy&rsquo;s servant to aid in his escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Seduction]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: The hermit accompanies you back to the Crystal Palace. Together you overthrow the guards and the evil king. The boy, you discover, was his oldest son, who now claims the throne and palace for his own! Grateful for your aid, he heaps awards and accolades upon you, and you become his most trusted advisor.
