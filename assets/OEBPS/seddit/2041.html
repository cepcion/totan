<p class="TaleDestiny">(2041) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Wandering the bazaar, you are accosted by a merchant who shows you a remarkable wooden box. With several deft motions, he shows you how to open it, and then lock it shut. Enchanted with the craftsmanship, you are determined to have it.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice and add one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Bargaining and Evaluation</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Beguiling, and Appearance</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: You cannot come to an agreement with the merchant. You leave sorely disappointed. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: You swiftly conclude your business with the merchant and carry your new-found treasure away. You waste no time manipulating the box as he showed you. As you expected, it is empty&mdash;the box itself is your treasure. Still, the inner dimensions seem odd to you.</li>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can leave it be, or use a dagger to pry at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you leave it be</span>: The box gives you great pleasure for several years, but you always wonder what it truly contains. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you pry at it</span>: You are more forceful than you wished, and shatter the item in your clumsy attempts. You disappointment is tempered, however, when a small rolled map falls from the secret compartment you opened.</li>
