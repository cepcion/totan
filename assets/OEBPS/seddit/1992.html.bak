<p class="TaleDestiny">(1992) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Thankful that luck has been with you as you cross the Valley of Dogs, you almost choose to ignore the scream of fear you hear. But how can stand by when another is in such danger? You see some bandits pushing around a pretty youngster: What you guess to be her father lies unconscious on the ground. If you catch them by surprise, you may be able to defeat them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you creep forwards, your foot crushes a branch. The sound seems to echo off the valley walls for an eternity. Immediately, the bandits give you chase. You lead them as far from the others as you can before you lose them. You hope the girl was able to escape. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: As quiet as a gazelle, you creep through the underbrush until you are close enough to a bandit that you could touch him with an outstretched hand. When they are all distracted by the youth&rsquo;s cries, you explode from the bushes and attack! In moments, the bandits lie at your feet. You can see in the youth&rsquo;s eyes that she has more than a mere &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; on her mind. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
