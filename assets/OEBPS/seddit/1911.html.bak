<p class="TaleDestiny">(1911) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>The unsightly view of the sickly other has plagued you for some days. You must be rid of the taunting visage before you take leave of your senses! However, the other wretched denizens of the Beggar&rsquo;s Quarter rise up to defend their own.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is hopeless&mdash;they are too many and they force you to withdraw. Finally, the memory of horror is more than you can bear. You flee the town, leaving your wits behind you. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: When it is clear that there are too many wretches for you to overcome on your own, you approach the captain of the Sultan&rsquo;s men to aid you in your task. He finds your charms irresistible, and before long the haunting face of the other is taken far from you. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
