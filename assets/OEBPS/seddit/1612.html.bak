<p class="TaleDestiny">(1612) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You should be more careful whom you hire! Not just a cad, the other is a liar as well. Soldiers stop you and bring you both before the Sultan. You are told that the other is a slave belonging to the Sultan and is a frequent runaway.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are dismissed and must find a new vassal. Not wishing to insult the Sultan, you leave. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You politely note to the nabobs of the court that the slave is obviously of little value due to his endless running away. They are silent, certain you will be struck down for your insolence, but the Sultan laughs and says, &ldquo;Your words are true and wise. I shall sell you the slave and you can deal with him.&rdquo; You free the slave and arrange to take his sale out of the slave&rsquo;s salary if he works for you. Because of your kindness, the slave reforms his ways and becomes your loyal vassal for many years. [D+2 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Courtly Graces]</p>
