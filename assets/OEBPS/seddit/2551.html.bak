<p class="TaleDestiny">(2551) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>When you arrive in this small town, the only thing on all lips is the reward being offered for the capture of a notorious criminal known to be in this area. You happen to have seen one who matches the description among a band of ruffians camping in a ravine on your way here. You head off and are fortunate to find the men still there. In time, the one you seek wanders into a small copse to relieve himself in privacy. Sneaking up, you place your sword to the back of his neck, saying, &ldquo;Come with me quietly.&rdquo; As you lead him away, he explains that he is not, in fact, a bandit, but is the other, disguised for his own purposes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You decide to let the local magistrates sort truth from fiction here, and deliver your captive for the reward. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You recognize the skill of the disguise and ask the other his story. The bandits, it transpires, slaughtered the other&rsquo;s entire family in a raid. The other swore justice and infiltrated the band. By cunning means, he eliminated all their leaders, leaving only the weak and foolish; the &ldquo;reward&rdquo; was his own plan to secure his role in the group. You are impressed by the audacity of the other&rsquo;s plan and assist him in completing his plan. [D+2 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
