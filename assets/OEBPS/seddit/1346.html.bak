<p class="TaleDestiny">(1346) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You spy on a woman crying over a wounded man. &ldquo;Every day I torture the prince who did this to you,&rdquo; she sobs.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: She goes to whip a man in another room. You stop her and demand to know his crime. She mutters a spell; you feel yourself changing. Perhaps in the future you will be careful around one who boasts of being a torturer! [D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: In a nearby room you find a young man&mdash;her prisoner. He tells the tale of how the woman turned him to stone and his people to fish. You return to her chamber and slay the evil enchantress, lifting the spell. [D+3 / S+3 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
