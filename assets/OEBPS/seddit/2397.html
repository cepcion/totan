<p class="TaleDestiny">(2397) - ENVIOUS (M)</p>
<p>You espy a bottle on the ground. As you approach, a voice booms out: &ldquo;Free me from this bottle and I&rsquo;ll grant your every desire, for I am a prince among my people and my power is infinite.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You retort, &ldquo;If your power were truly infinite, you would not need my help!&rdquo; And thus saying, you continue on your journey. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS (mandatory)</span>: Thinking that all you desire might finally be granted to you, you hasten to perform this simple task. As you open the bottle, smoke issues forth. Laughter booms from within the cloud. &ldquo;Foolish mortals, will you never understand the price for helping one of the mighty &rsquo;efreet?&rdquo; The smoke covers your head and you pass out. When you awaken, you are not where you were. [S+1 / Have another player move you three spaces in any direction]</p>
