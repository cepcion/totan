<p class="TaleDestiny">(1933) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>After a late night of heavy drinking, you find yourself in the company of the other. He tells you his tale of woe.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: One of such horrendous visage could never earn the love of a chaste maiden. Though you cannot help the other, at least you can pay for his drinks. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: As you listen to the other&rsquo;s tale, you are reminded of a legend you heard while sailing between the Pillars of Hercules. It is said that an island there has a spring, and whoever drinks of its waters will fall instantly in love with the first person in sight. The other thanks you for your tale and leaves immediately, no doubt bound for the island of legend! Would that you could be just as determined! [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
