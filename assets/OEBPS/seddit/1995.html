<p class="TaleDestiny">(1995) - PIETY</p>
<p>A lovely but brazen maiden offers fertility charms in the market place. You recognize the liquid as nothing more than wine. You bow to her, and politely offer her a fine robe, explaining that it will make her appear more chaste and improve her chances of making a sale.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: She is offended by your assumption that she is wanton. She tells anyone who will listen that you have maligned her virtue and caused her distress. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Pleased by your offer and impressed by your reasoning, she takes the cloak and dons it. She repays your generosity with a portion of her brisk sales. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Beguiling]</p>
