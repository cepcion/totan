<p class="TaleDestiny">(1368) - PIETY</p>
<p>You marvel at the wealth and power of the sea kingdoms, and speak to the local Sultan of the riches he could possess if he attacked his neighbors. You discover that he had long coveted power, and gladly appoints you his warlord.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You lead the attack, and are miserably defeated, for the tactics of undersea warfare are quite different from those you know. The troops you command are decimated, and you escape only through the grace of Allah. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: As you practice the troops for the war, you soon realize that mermen have no talent as warriors. In a sudden insight, you realize that Allah means these kings to live in peace! You reveal your inspiration to the Sultan. Humbled by your piety, he accepts the True Faith. [D+3 / S+3 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
