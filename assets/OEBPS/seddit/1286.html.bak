<p class="TaleDestiny">(1286) - BEGUILING, MAGIC LAMP</p>
<p>The wizard agrees to your proposition. At the cave he enacts a powerful spell. The ground opens and you enter. &ldquo;Hurry,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;I cannot hold it forever.&rdquo; You enter and find a brass lamp, fill your pockets with gems, and return to the wizard. &ldquo;Pass me up the lamp,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do, and he runs off. When you emerge, he is gone with your lamp. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You refuse, distrusting him. He grows furious and seals the hole above you. Idly, you rub the lamp. An &rsquo;efreet appears, saying, &ldquo;At your service.&rdquo; You bid him free you from the cave, which he does, and then he returns to the lamp. [D+3 / S+3 / Luck / Magic Lamp]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC LAMP</span>: Gladly you hand it to him, for you know it to be a false imitation of the true magic lamp. He cackles in delight and runs off, and you go your own way with the gems. [D+2 / S+2 / W+4 (Max: Princely) / Beguiling]</p>
