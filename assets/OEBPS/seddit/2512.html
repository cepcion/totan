<p class="TaleDestiny">(2512) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Sand burns your feet as you stumble through the merciless desert. By providence, a rickety shack appears in the shade of several large rocks. Using your last vestiges of strength, you push your way inside. There you find a threadbare cot, a broken chair, and a wobbly table. A fine bottle of wine sits on the table. You accept this oddity with little more than a passing thought, gulp down the excellent vintage, and slump exhausted on the cot.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You awake to find a large man looming over you, bearing a stick in one hand and almost superhuman rage on his face. You have consumed his last treasure, leaving him with nothing to barter for food. He beats you soundly, calling upon the wrath of Allah to teach you a lesson in right and wrong. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You awake just moments before the old wooden door swings open, and you quickly hide under the bed. You see the large feet of an obviously powerful man move to the table. A scream of rage sounds, dissolving into wretched sobs of despair. As he cries, you stealthily exit the shack and sprint off into the wilderness. [D+2 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
