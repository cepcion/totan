<p class="TaleDestiny">(2517) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You spy a small, tattered tent at the mouth of a desolate canyon. Hoping to gain some information about the area, you approach the other who lives therein, a once-wealthy merchant who has fallen on very hard times. &ldquo;I have passed many times through this valley in my travels, and would be willing to guide you through if you would buy shares in my latest endeavor,&rdquo; he tells you. You study the wilderness as you weigh your offer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The canyon does not appear daunting. You claim you are fine on your own, and ignoring him, you set off into the cursed passage. You travel for days until, dying of thirst and unsound of mind, you reach the end. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The area appears unnatural and you decide not to attempt passage alone. Noting the poor health of the other, you offer, instead of investment, to carry the other&rsquo;s goods across the canyon if he acts as a guide. Surprised, the other accepts. Because of the other&rsquo;s intimate knowledge of the area, before you even know it you are both across the canyon. [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
