<p class="TaleDestiny">(1670) - PIETY, MAGIC, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You overhear two lovers talking hurriedly. They are clearly panicked and out of breath, having run as far as they could to be away from a jealous
&rsquo;efreet who kept the younger of the two as a slave of love. As they debate where to go next, the very jinni appears before them!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You scream in surprise and rush forward unthinking, drawing a blade. The jinni looks you over with bored contempt and dismisses you with a wave of the left hand. As blackness fills your mind, the jinni takes back his lover and flies away, leaving you and the heartbroken suitor otherwise unharmed. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY, MAGIC, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: You command the jinni to leave the couple alone, for the Most High has dictated that man and woman should join together with their own kind. The jinni is taken aback by the force of your words and eventually sees the sense of what you say and departs. The young couple tell all they meet of your bravery. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
