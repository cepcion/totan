<p class="TaleDestiny">(731) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Strange sparks like glowing snowflakes are drifting from the window of a small, isolated hut. Alarmed, you crouch down in the shelter of tall shrubs.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hide in fear for awhile, averting your eyes from the strange sight. Finally you gather enough courage to look up&mdash;and discover it has vanished! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Though frightened, you approach the hut, moving silently through the brush. A wizened figure in colorful robes emerges. You take a chance, running through the door as the wizard steps away. Inside, resting near a forge, is a magically glowing spear. You snatch it and dash off into the darkness, the wizard&rsquo;s howls of rage echoing behind you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (WIZARD) / Sparkling Spear]</p>
