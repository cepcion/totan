<p class="TaleDestiny">(2484) - WEAPON USE  (M), STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You watch a cold-blooded murderer be taken away by the local magistrate, the blood of your favorite cousin still on her hands. You are filled with rage and can barely contain the urge to kill the woman who has made your cousin&rsquo;s wife a widow and his children fatherless. You will make her pay for her crimes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Late that night, you head over to the jail. You pretend to stagger and offer the guard your wine skin. &ldquo;I can drink no more,&rdquo; you explain. The jailor gladly consumes the wine and falls asleep. You wake the prisoner and, once she recognizes you, you drive your sword into her chest. [D+1 / Acting and Disguise / Lose Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: As darkness falls, you creep quietly into the jail. For long hours, you move slowly and carefully, hiding in impossible positions, barely breathing. In time, you reach the murderer&rsquo;s cell and make your presence known. Although she is at your mercy, you cannot bring yourself to kill her. However, you make sure she knows you could have.
