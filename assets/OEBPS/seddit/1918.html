<p class="TaleDestiny">(1918) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You heart is filled with pity at the plight of the other. You desire to do him a kindness by sharing your hard-earned wealth.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You try to negotiate with the other, when he reveals that is actually a dervish in search of an honest man. Your desire for wealth has disappointed the holy man, who vanishes in a puff of dusty wind. He leaves behind only his disguise. [D-1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
