<p class="TaleDestiny">(279) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>If you had known that the powerful other is infamous for his cruelty and misanthropy, you would never have approached him. You seem fortunate, however, for he says in a honeyed voice, &ldquo;It is my policy to occasionally reveal the generous side of my personality. What favor may I grant you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You make your request.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Appearance</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Acting and Disguise</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: Your request must have been too much; he explodes in rage at your presence, and calls down curses on your impertinent head. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: To your great surprise, he grants your favor willingly! You take your boon and hurry off before you can arouse his wrath accidentally. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / You may lose one status of your choice]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your tact and clever tongue lead you to make a reasonable request while avoiding the powerful other&rsquo;s wrath. Your request is granted graciously. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / You may lose one status of your choice]</p>
