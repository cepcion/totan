<p class="TaleDestiny">(1798) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>While you are sleeping, a horrible black giant seizes you and carries you off to his pavilion, where he tells you that he intends to cook and eat you in the morning. Looking about, you realize that your only hope for escape lies with the giant&rsquo;s rather unpleasant-looking offspring.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You challenge the giant child to a test of strength. You claim that you can throw the child farther than he can throw you. You even offer to let him make the first toss. You are lucky that there was a deep river on the other side of the ridge, or else your landing would have been extremely painful.

Now if only you knew where you were&hellip; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You secretly promise the giant child a tasty treat if it will help you make your escape. Though it is afraid of angering its father, the lure of a delicious sweet proves too strong to resist. After the cage is opened, you give the child some honey cakes you have been saving, and sneak away into the night. [S+1 / Seduction]</p>
