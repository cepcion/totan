<p>You offer your services to the other and are promised a nice purse as payment. After performing your service you are given only the purse. &ldquo;I did say your payment would be a nice purse. And I happen to think that is a very nice purse.&rdquo; You leave, prepared for the next time you have to deal with those who wield the Dark Arts. [Wisdom]</p>
