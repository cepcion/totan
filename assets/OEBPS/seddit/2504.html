<p class="TaleDestiny">(2504) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>A wealthy merchant asks that you retrieve a prized racehorse that has been stolen from his home by bandits. Angered by the loss of such a magnificent beast, you head out directly, without even negotiating a price for your service. You follow the horse&rsquo;s tracks and find that they are joined by a number of others. In the end, you discover a band of horse thieves with a sizeable herd. The bandits are celebrating their work, contemplating the newfound wealth that will soon be theirs.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unwilling to take on so many armed ruffians, and unsure what else to do, you sit down to keep watch. Alas, your intentions are better than your determination; you fall asleep and the bandits ride away before you can act. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You sneak your way to the side of the horse you have been sent to retrieve. There, you raise a horrible clamor, spooking the horses around you. As they scatter in all directions, you leap upon the merchant&rsquo;s horse and ride off, crouching low in the saddle. The bandits are distracted trying to round up their stolen animals and you escape back to town. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
