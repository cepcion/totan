<p class="TaleDestiny">(1627) - PIETY  (M)</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s features twist and contort until a being of blood, fire, and scale stands before you. His grim rumble of a laugh lasts what seems like an hour before he sets out the terms. He will serve you, but you must give him your soul in exchange.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shake hands on the deal with the creature. You watch as the creature turns into inky smoke and enters your nose and mouth. You hunch over in pain as your entire head feels as though it is on fire. You pass out from the pain only to awake a short time later, twisted and changed. [Magic / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> There is no way you could possibly accept such a deal, as it would be the greatest of affronts to Allah. You pray until the demon leaves, but feel tainted even by having attempted to hire such a beast and know that you must atone. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>]</p>
