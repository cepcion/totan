<p class="TaleDestiny">(1696) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>While you are exploring the veldt, you encounter an intrepid band of hunters. After breaking bread and sharing salt, you learn that they are seeking the mysterious elephant, and you convince them to allow you to join their group for a small fee.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you are not a knowledgeable hunter, your keen senses prove valuable to the hunters when you are the first to spot their quarry. They agree to let you travel with them for a time. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: During the hunt, you entertain the band of hunters with tales of the mysterious Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. After a week, you finally see your elephant: an aged and wrinkled bull. The leader of the band decides to follow it to see if your tales are true.</p>

<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;9: If there is an Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard, this bull didn&rsquo;t live long enough to find it. But at least you can retrieve the ivory without danger. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">10+: Following at a safe distance, you watch the sickly old bull stumble and fall over a cliff. Approaching the lip, you realize it is the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard! [Go to paragraph <a href="1193.html#TaleHeader">1193</a>]</li>
