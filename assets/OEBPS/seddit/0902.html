<p class="TaleDestiny">(902) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You caught only a glimpse of the creature from your hiding place but it was the most marvelous thing you have ever seen. You can do nothing but follow.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The beauty of it drives all else from your mind. You will never rest until you have found it. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Though it seems your heart will burst, you must turn aside and give up this obsession. Once you have done, you feel relieved of a great burden. Truly, it is the path of wisdom to recognize when a task is foolish. [D+2 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You produce the Golden Bridle, but the beast resists its power. Recognizing the beast&rsquo;s strength, you decide it would be best left alone. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
