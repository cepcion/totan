<p>The other defends himself with ease from your attack.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Cunningly, he pushes you into a vegetable-seller&rsquo;s stall and makes good his escape. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You drop your sword and beg for mercy. Surprised, he lowers his sword. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know I was winning,&rdquo; he says. Taking advantage of his surprise, you leap on him and wrestle him to the ground. You cannot hold him, but he flees, leaving you clutching his purse and a bag containing small, hard cakes. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Magic Cakes]</p>
