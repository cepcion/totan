</p> The unfortunate other accepts your aid and thanks you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He praises you for your good heart, but because of his poor state, he cannot return your generosity. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, APPEARANCE</span>: The fortunes of the other you aided improve dramatically, and you are remembered as one who was generous in time of need. Truly do the blessings of the Most High visit those who are kind to the needy! [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)/ <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
