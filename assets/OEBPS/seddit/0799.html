<p class="TaleDestiny">(799) - DETERMINED (M), WEAPON USE (M)</p>
<p>Your victim cries out and flees as you attack. Suddenly he is joined by others. You are outnumbered and have lost the advantage of surprise.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Wisely, you withdraw. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED, WEAPON USE  (All mandatory)</span>: In fury, you attack anyway. Though you kill and injure many, you are eventually overcome and taken captive. The Sultan sees no reason for leniency and has you whipped before he throws you in a cell. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
