<p class="TaleDestiny">(1281) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>With the spell of opening, the door slides aside. Within the cave is a huge pit of flame. A tall tree in the center bears jewels instead of fruit.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You string a rope across the pit and the tree in the center, but as you go hand-over-hand the rope sags, and the flames singe you. You retreat outside the cave, and later discover that you cannot re-enter! Still, better to have forsaken the treasure than to have died in flame. [D+2 / S+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You swath yourself in water-soaked rags and reach the tree. You are blistered but console yourself with your great wealth.
[D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> (1 turn)]</p>
