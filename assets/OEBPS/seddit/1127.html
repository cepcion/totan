<p class="TaleDestiny">(1127) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>Before you is a magnificent city with towering spires, exquisite ornamentation, and enduring craftsmanship. Not a soul has viewed this scene for centuries.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You feel a slight uneasiness, a sense of a disapproving presence. The enticement of the riches, however, is too strong to resist, and you help yourself to what you can find. Even when you depart, though, the foul feeling lingers. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: On the walls are engraved many admonishments to those who dishonor the dead, warning that the Destroyer of Delights comes to us all. You copy the inscriptions rather than loot the city, and collect them into a book of verse. The beauty of your translation brings you great honor. [D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
