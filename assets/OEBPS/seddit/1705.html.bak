<p class="TaleDestiny">(1705) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>What you first believed to be two ships lashed together is actually a ship that has somehow discovered the floating remains of a dendan. You hail the other ship, and its captain offers to sell you a small supply of the precious oil.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Once the two ships part ways, you realize that you have been taken by a charlatan! How could he have tricked you so effectively? This stuff is nothing more than olive oil! At least you learned a valuable lesson. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Beguiling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: It takes a thief to catch one, and you are very skilled at pretending to be something you are not. Apparently, so is this captain. A closer examination reveals that the &ldquo;dendan&rdquo; is a clever decoy, and the oil a fake! You quickly excuse yourself and continue on your way. [S+1]</p>
