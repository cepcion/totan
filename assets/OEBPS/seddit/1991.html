<p class="TaleDestiny">(1991) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Making your way across the dreaded Valley of Dogs, you encounter a man dressed in tatters and furs. You call out to a fellow traveler, hoping he can help you in this dangerous land&mdash;but without a word he attacks you madly and you are forced to slay him in your defense.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You thank Allah for sending you a warning and proceed with doubled caution. You are able to avoid two other bands of such wild men before you reach the far side of the valley. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Investigating the man closely, you realize that this is one of the ruthless bandits you were warned about. You disguise yourself in the man&rsquo;s garments. Your ploy proves effective, as you bypass one group of rogues easily. But the second band you meet is far more curious, and you are forced to fight for your life. Allah lends strength to your arm, and you leave the field of battle littered with the bodies of evil men. [D+1 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
