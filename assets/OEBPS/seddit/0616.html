<p class="TaleDestiny">(616) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You sit and await whatever fate Allah has ordained for you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are not pleased, but resigned, when your fate includes starving near to death, being attacked by animals and brigands, suffering from exposure in a terrible storm, and, finally, being discovered on the point of death by a band of wandering dervishes. The dervishes, however, are endlessly amazed by your tales, and they aid you in your return to health and civilization. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: With your great skill, you live comfortably off the land until one day you spy a group of traveling dervishes, who lead you back to civilization. They are endlessly fascinated by your tales of life in the wilderness. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
