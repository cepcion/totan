<p>The other looks at you reflectively. &ldquo;Due to my wealth and powers, I find myself constantly approached by false friends and lovers. Though I admit I am impressed with your charms, I must assume you to be the same until you prove otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although you know in your heart that you are not false, the other will not give you a chance to prove it. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: To prove your sincerity, you give the other lessons in the amorous arts.</p>

<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are of the opposite sex from the other and are not Married</span>: Your lesson does not cease until morning, and he does not tire of instruction. When you are finished, he cannot bear to be parted from your company. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: You discourse long into the evening on the ways to bring satisfaction to one&rsquo;s lovers, and the other is most eager to continue his studies with another. Before you part, he promises to speak highly of you to all he meets. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
