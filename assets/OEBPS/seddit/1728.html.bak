<p class="TaleDestiny">(1728) - LUCK</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord of All hears the plea of every heart,&rdquo; you tell the villagers. That night, they retreat into the mosque to pray for divine aid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the apes are unwilling to attack the mosque, though they have no qualms about ravaging the rest of the village. At least the villagers won&rsquo;t have to sleep in their boats tomorrow. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: While exploring the mosque, you discover a most curious statue, carved in the likeness of an ape and made from some unknown stone. Presenting it to the apes that night, you learn that it was what they sought all along, and promise to leave the villagers in peace. The villagers throw a celebration in your honor and shower you with gifts. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
