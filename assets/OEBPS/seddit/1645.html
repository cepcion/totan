<p class="TaleDestiny">(1645) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You come across the other struggling to escape from twisting vines that move on their own. He cries out once before getting dragged back into the floral mass, out of sight.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You blindly strike at the vines, hoping to cut him free. Each blow cuts away some plant matter, but you cannot find the other again.
[S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You cut into the vines, skillfully slicing away the mass while taking care not to touch the trapped other. After a few seconds of this, you reach in and pull him out. He takes a huge breath and praises your bravery and skill. He was a simple gardener whose plants were cursed while he tended to them. Were it not for your actions, he surely would have been swallowed by the foliage. Though he has no wealth to reward you, he teaches you all that he knows about the woods. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
