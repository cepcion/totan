<p class="TaleDestiny">(1710) - MAGIC</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dendan!&rdquo; The cry rang across the deck as one of the hands points out to sea. It is obvious that it is heading straight for your ship! In a panic, you dive overboard into the frothy water.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You discover that you cannot swim faster than a dendan. As you struggle to escape, the giant fin of the beast grazes your side, and a crimson cloud of blood spreads into the water around you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: No man can swim better than a fish. But you do remember a little enchantment that a mermaid taught you in your younger years that just might be enough to let you get away. [S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
