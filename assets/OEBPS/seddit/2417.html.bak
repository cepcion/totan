<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hire a slave to play at being your spouse. Unfortunately, the slave doesn&rsquo;t perform well. However, seeing the length to which you will go to avoid this relationship, the jinni leaves you alone. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You purchase an elixir from an apothecary that will bring a pall of death about you. You seek out the love-stricken other and promptly die in front of them. Your performance is so convincing the other wails to the sky. As hot tears burn your chest, you feel yourself picked up, and flown in the air! You strive to keep your deception as the wind whips past you. Finally, you are laid to rest on cold stone. The other kisses your forehead and leaves. When you dare to stir, you find yourself in a tomb.
