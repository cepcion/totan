<p class="TaleDestiny">(1285) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You climb a rope up into the mist. There you find a peak with a tunnel carved into it and start down. Soon you stand before a man wearing a red helmet, who says, &ldquo;You cannot pass until I have fallen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot master him, for truly he is the most skilled swordsman you have ever seen; exhausted, you retreat. [D+2 / S+2 / Weapon Use]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Truly he is a skilled foe, but you are greater. When you conquer him he bows and conducts you through rooms filled with treasure. [D+3 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / Treasure]
