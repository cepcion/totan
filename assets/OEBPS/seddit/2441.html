<p class="TaleDestiny">(2441) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>That Allah could allow such hideous beasts to profane the earth, you cannot understand. But you know that you cannot allow them to roam free and threaten the lives of innocent people any longer.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You attempt to lure the creatures into a trap, but they prove to be much faster than you imagined! Before the townsfolk can come to aid you, they have gashed you terribly. Your wounds will recover, but will your pride? [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You convince some of the townsfolk to act as bait to lure the beasts into your trap. The creatures are much faster than you imagined, and you feel some guilt at the terrible fate that two of the townsfolk suffer, but now the creatures are safely locked away in cages.
