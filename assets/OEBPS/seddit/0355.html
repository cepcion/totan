<p class="TaleDestiny">(355) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can always use the aid of others,&rdquo; cackles your host. &ldquo;There is one that I wish to rend limb from limb for his past crimes against me.&rdquo; You are surprised when he names a virtuous Vizier of wide renown&mdash;a man above reproach.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: <span class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may assist the other, or refuse</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you assist him</span>: The Vizier is easily delivered to his death, though he utters a terrible curse on all who acted against him. You are rewarded by the other&rsquo;s accomplices for your part in the foul undertaking. [D-1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Lose Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you refuse</span>: The other is furious when you refuse, robs from you much of your wealth, and vows your destruction. [D+1 / S+1 / W-3 (Min: Penniless) / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You realize that the other is nothing but a wicked schemer. You pretend to assist the other but secretly warn the Vizier of his danger. You manage to trap him who sought your aid. The Vizier is most grateful and commends you to the Sultan. [D+3 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
