<p class="TaleDestiny">(2460) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>In the dark of night, your soul quivers to the sound of mysterious chanting. Steeling your resolve, you approach the sound to discover a circle of evil Magian fire-worshippers surrounding the egg of an enormous roc!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cower in the darkness, fearful for your life and praying for the All-Mighty to aid you. Perhaps it was in answer to your prayers that the mother of the egg arrived in time, sending the Magians fleeing for their lives! [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You have heard that such dark rituals must be completed very carefully. Even a slight interruption can make the spell turn on the casters. At what seems a crucial moment, you fling your water bag into their fire, scattering the coals and dousing the flame! You may never know what happened in the confusion and darkness that follows, but when dawn arrives, the egg is gone and the Magians lie quiet on the ground. [D+1 / S+1 / Magic]</p>
