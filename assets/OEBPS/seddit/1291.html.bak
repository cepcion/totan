<p class="TaleDestiny">(1291) - WISDOM, PIETY</p>
<p>Through the darkness of the house a shadowy presence looms nearer and nearer! Ah! It is only the Vizier! You reveal yourself, and he says, &ldquo;I have come to seek aid in deposing the Sultan. Aid me, and you will be my Vizier.&rdquo; You consider what he has said.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree&mdash;and suddenly the Sultan&rsquo;s guards are all around you! The Sultan himself steps forward! &ldquo;False one!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;Is this how you would repay me?&rdquo; You are thrown in prison to contemplate the folly of your deeds. [D+1 / S+2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM, PIETY</span>: You flatly refuse and draw your sword. &ldquo;Hold!&rdquo; cries a second voice, and the Sultan himself steps forward. He explains, &ldquo;A prophecy told me to adopt a worthy stranger as my true heir. This test confirms my thoughts&mdash;you are the one. &ldquo;A few weeks later he dies, and you become the new Sultan. [D+3 / S+3 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
