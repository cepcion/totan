<p class="TaleDestiny">(1738) - SEAMANSHIP, LUCK</p>
<p>Sitting at the seashore, you contemplate the fate of the village.</p>
<p>A grizzled old fisherman rows by in his small craft. Striking up a conversation, you learn of a hospitable island free of the apes. Armed with this knowledge, you go into the village to convince all there to load their belongings onto their small boats and relocate to the other island. The villages pool their money to hire the fisherman and his friends to take them there.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The journey proves rough, as the small boats struggle in the ocean currents. Many days after your supplies run out, you arrive on the distant island, but not before some of the villagers succumb to sickness. [D+1 / S+1 / Seamanship / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP, LUCK</span>: As soon as the small boats leave sight of land, a powerful ocean current sweeps you along, depositing you and the villagers on a nearby island. Allah, the benevolent, has seen fit to guide you to a new Eden! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
