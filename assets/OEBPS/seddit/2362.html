<p class="TaleDestiny">(2362) - SCHOLARSHIP, WISDOM</p>
<p>You offer the other your respectful greetings, and ask whether you may be of any assistance. The other looks you up and down and says, &ldquo;Indeed, I could use your help. There is one who owes me a large sum of money. I would like you to retrieve it for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You follow the directions on finding this person and when you do, you accost him roughly, demanding money. &ldquo;You dare soil my robes with your beggar hands? Guards, arrest this vagrant!&rdquo; The other took you for a fool and rightly so: next time, you will get more detail about someone you are supposed to approach so that you don&rsquo;t run blindly into another Vizier. [D+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, WISDOM</span>: You immediately recognize the &ldquo;debtor&rdquo; as the Vizier of this land, and realize the other has tried to make a fool of you. You turn the tables by telling the Vizier that the other is spreading false and vicious rumors about him. The Vizier has the other arrested and you are rewarded for your loyalty. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
