<p>Studying in the library, you find a tale of an enchantress who lives in a cave by the sea. This sorceress apparently had the ability to twist men&rsquo;s wills according to her whims. The tale was told by someone named Nawfal the Unfortunate. Greedy to know more, and possibly gain this power for yourself, you seek out Nawfal. Finding the ancient one, you offer coins in exchange for a more complete story. Nawfal cannot refuse; the wicked one&rsquo;s curse requires a lengthy recital. You learn a crucial bit of information: the location of the enchantress. Before you set off, you review a number of texts for wards against enchantment.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With dreams of convincing princes to surrender their treasure or &rsquo;efreets to give up their magics, you accost the sorceress. Alas, she but waves a hand and all your protections shatter, which brings you under her spell along with all the others. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Forewarned is forearmed. The vile hag cannot pierce your wards and is defenseless before your weapons. She grudgingly teaches you many powerful secrets. [D+2 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 use)]</p>
