<p>Your soliloquy in the town square about the evils of the other comes so powerfully from within you that you barely notice when the guards arrive to arrest you. It seems that the other is a favorite of the Vizier!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You plead your case before the court, but the Vizier does not believe you. He orders you cast into his dungeons. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: The Vizier learns of your skills as a sailor. He has need of such a man as you. He agrees to spare your life in exchange for your delivering a message across a particularly dangerous sea. [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
