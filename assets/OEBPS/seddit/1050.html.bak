<p class="TaleDestiny">(1050) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s greedy eye falls upon everyone&rsquo;s possessions. You determine to teach him a lesson. You begin to flatter and toady to him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He suspects your motives and keeps a careful eye on you. He robs several others but leaves you alone. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: He accepts you, and asks you to help rob the others. You pretend to agree. One night you rush to his cabin crying, &ldquo;Hurry, we are discovered! To the lifeboat!&rdquo; In a daze, he stumbles into the lifeboat; you shove him adrift in the ocean (with ample provisions) and help yourself to his possessions. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
