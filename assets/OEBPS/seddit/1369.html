<p class="TaleDestiny">(1369) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Amazed at the wealth of the undersea kings, you encourage one of them to form his people into an army to conquer a neighboring city. After training them, you lead the conquering horde.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: For all of your time here, you have not mastered the strange weapons and tactics of the mermen. The battle is lost, and you manage to escape only by a clever ruse. [D+2 / S+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: By committing the sawfish and the seahorse-cavalry at the right moment, you win the day. The grateful Sultan gives you governorship of the conquered kingdom. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
