<p class="TaleDestiny">(1431) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>A bead of sweat drips down your forehead.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> The other stares at you with wild eyes. &ldquo;So, we meet again! Now you shall pay for your crimes!&rdquo; He makes a magical pass, and the Protective Talisman glows warmly against your flesh as it turns aside the attack. The other stops, and says, &ldquo;I must have been mistaken. You are not he who I thought you were.&rdquo; With that, he departs. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
