<p class="TaleDestiny">(2581) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You seek to punish a hated rival, and you have met the other, who will make the perfect instrument of your revenge. The other appears to pass on madness to any who spends too long nearby. For a simple payment&mdash;a dozen fruits, a half gallon of flower-water, and a single stuffed eel&mdash;the other will sit outside your rival&rsquo;s home and gibber for days on end. Soon your victim will be gnawing at his fingernails and pulling out his hair.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, there was a flaw to your carefully laid plan: the mad are by their very nature unpredictable. Instead of remaining in one place, the mad one wanders the neighborhood, infecting all encountered. Word circulates that you are responsible for this blight. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The trick, you realize, with any mad person is to keep a close eye out. You spend your days following the mad one in various guises. A gesture here, a guiding voice there, and the insane one remains in place, driving your rival mad with seemingly random chicken attacks, wines spilled on his best robes, and howling dogs outside of every window of every room in which he tries to sleep. You also learn a thing or two about discipline and commitment. The time you spend near the mad one, however, also drives you insane. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
