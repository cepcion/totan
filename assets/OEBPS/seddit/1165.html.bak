<p class="TaleDestiny">(1165) - QUICK THINKING, OUTLAW  (M)</p>
<p>You call a barber to cut your hair before you meet your love. The barber, who calls himself The Silent, proceeds to vaunt his knowledge of alchemy, astrology, white magic, grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic, and the Traditions of the Prophet. He somehow omits to cut your hair.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You chase him all about, but the old coot is surprisingly spry; you manage to fall and break a leg. Needless to say, you miss your rendezvous with your love. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You challenge him to demonstrate his powers by getting out of a locked trunk, and he agrees. Your friends carry the trunk to the river and toss it in while you hurry to meet your love.
[D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if not Married)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">OUTLAW  (mandatory):</span> Finally at the end of your patience, you snatch up his razor and cut out his tongue. You regret your rash action, as he turns out to be an especial favorite of the Caliph. Your head is removed, and placed up on a pole as a warning to other impetuous travelers.
