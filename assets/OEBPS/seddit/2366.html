<p class="TaleDestiny">(2366) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Drawing your weapon, you leap at the other with a proud battle cry.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other raises a hand, and your weapon wrenches itself from your grip. Another gesture, and it attacks you as though it were wielded by an invisible jinni. [<span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other gestures and your sword transforms into a snake! Without hesitation, you strike the other with the reptile and it bites him. Instead of a quick death, the other lies writhing on the floor, slowly dying, as the serpent&rsquo;s poison courses through his body.
