<p class="TaleDestiny">(2129) - STORYTELLING, PIETY</p>
<p>A gang of evil-looking men surround you and demand your money, laughing and taunting you. You ask them why they wish to target you, who have done them no harm.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They keep laughing as they rob you and ride off. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, PIETY</span>: They refuse to answer, so you change tactics. You relate to them the tale of an innocent who is beaten by a gang of men. In the story, the gang suddenly runs afoul of terrible luck. The telling of the tale, and your obvious devotion to the All Powerful, stays their hands and changes their minds. They let you go in peace. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
