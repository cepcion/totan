<p class="TaleDestiny">(1632) - LUCK</p>
<p>As you offer your greetings to the other, he falls to his knees before you! The other tells of his own many hardships, including a curse cast by a jealous competitor. The curse can only be lifted by a blessing from one born outdoors under a new moon in midwinter.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You beg for the other not to come along because of his curse. Alas, it seems that even this brief amount of time with him has rubbed off on you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: How can it be, but that you, yourself, were so born? You bless the other, his curse is lifted&mdash;and you are blessed in return! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
