<p class="TaleDestiny">(1974) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You have heard stories of volcanoes from your early childhood, but you have never had an opportunity to see one, and you wish to see this wonder firsthand. You are in a small port when you overhear a sailor telling a tale of escaping from an erupting volcano and try to convince him to take you there.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The sailor tells you at great length of the horrors he has seen, which leave him too frightened to risk sailing close enough to see it again. Nothing you say convinces him to go. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: It takes a healthy amount of gold to convince the frightened sailor to guide you to the volcanic island. The magnificent beauty of the island alone is worth it. What you learn from the voyage is doubly so. [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
