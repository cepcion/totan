<p>The other boards a ship and you are not sure how you will be able to follow. Just as you are about to give up a sailor notices you. &ldquo;Are you here to join the crew?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You say that you are but that you don&rsquo;t know anything about being a sailor. The other says that they are short crew members and that they will teach you along the way. You learn a trade and continue to spy on the other. The skill gained from the former proves handy; the results of the latter are fruitless. [Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: &ldquo;Am I too late?&rdquo; you ask. &ldquo;No, says the other. The new captain is the one who is late.&rdquo; Thinking quickly and forgetting the one you follow you ask, &ldquo;Have you ever met this new man?&rdquo; &ldquo;Not as yet,&rdquo; says the sailor.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then perhaps you should be more careful who you are disrespectful around!&rdquo; You clap the other upside the head and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the new captain and was testing you! Now set for sail before I clap you again!&rdquo; You procure the ship owner&rsquo;s orders from the first mate and work making a fine living as the captain for some months&mdash;until you are set to meet with the ship owner. You disappear in the night before your meeting. [D+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise)</p>
