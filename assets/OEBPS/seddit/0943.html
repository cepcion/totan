<p class="TaleDestiny">(943) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You have come to the nest of the greatest of birds, the roc: surely you praise Allah for His wondrous works. You remain motionless as you watch the egg.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After a time a huge roc settles down upon it. Suddenly you are amazed to see a Sultan and hundreds of men emerge from hiding and subdue the huge creature. A delightful story! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You realize the egg is fake&mdash;could it be a lure for a real roc? As a roc approaches, you note soldiers hiding in the bushes.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may wait in hiding or warn the roc away from the soldiers:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you wait</span>: Hundreds of men emerge from hiding and slay the glorious creature. What an ignominious death for such a noble creature! [D-1 / S+1]</li>
</ul>
