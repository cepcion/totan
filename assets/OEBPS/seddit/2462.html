<p class="TaleDestiny">(2462) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>For most of the morning, you have been watching the mass of black, taloned birds hanging over the road ahead. From time to time, some would dive to the earth below before returning to the milling cloud. As you draw closer, you see that they are worrying a strange winged creature, half-woman, half-lion, who lies wounded on the ground, barely able to crawl. You ride forward to help the wounded beast.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Shouting and howling, you spur your mount and swing your sword above your head, hoping to chase off the blood-thirsty creatures. They scatter at your efforts. However, as you ride past the creature on the ground, it swipes out with its fierce claws, killing your horse in a single stroke. One should not expect gratitude from a monster! [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: As you come closer, you recognize the creature on the ground as a sphinx from legend! You pause to light a torch and ride into the midst of the &ldquo;birds,&rdquo; swinging the torch about like a censer and dispersing them. You keep your distance from the monster until you have exacted a promise from it to share with you the treasure of its centuries of preying on travelers. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
