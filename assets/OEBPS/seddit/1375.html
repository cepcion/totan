<p class="TaleDestiny">(1375) - PIETY</p>
<p>You top the hill. Below you see a council of &rsquo;efreeti numbering in the hundreds. They ask who you are, and you meekly reply that you are a great and powerful wizard. They laugh uproariously and advance menacingly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your most powerful spells are as child&rsquo;s play to these great beings. They force you back, and you must flee. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: When you find your magics ineffective, you call down the wrath of Allah upon these evil beings. At the name they cover their ears and howl in agony. You force them to submit to the will of the Most High and learn many of their secrets. [D+3 / S+3 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Piety / Magic]</p>
