<p class="TaleDestiny">(1801) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You enter a large clearing dominated by a large pavilion. You see an enormous black giant laboriously lashing a struggling captive to a spit, no doubt intended for the large fire.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Being careful that the giant does not notice you, you sneak behind the pavilion and find a large barrel full of water. You push the barrel over, and the water flows into the fire, extinguishing it in a great cloud of smoke and ash! In the confusion that follows, you quickly free the young man and flee, leaving the pavilion far behind you. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You call to the giant, offering to share with him a tale so wondrous it is unlike any he has ever heard before if he agrees to release his prisoner. The giant agrees on the condition that if he dislikes your tale, you will take the man&rsquo;s place! When he finally stops laughing from the Tale of the Barber&rsquo;s Third Brother, he agrees to release both you and the other man. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
