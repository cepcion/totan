<p class="TaleDestiny">(1030) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>While riding in the wilderness, you come upon a gooleh. She looks at you, licks her chops, bares fangs, and bars your way; behind you, another like her appears. &ldquo;We bear you no malice, but we must eat,&rdquo; she says, grinning. &ldquo;It is the way of goolehs to feed on men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to pray to Allah for deliverance but are frozen with terror. The goolehs fall upon you, slaying your mount and wounding you. In a terror-inspired frenzy, you escape. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: To distract them, you start telling stories. In each, a character cries out for deliverance and is saved as lightning strikes the foe dead. Apprehensively, the goolehs glance repeatedly at the gathering storm clouds. Suddenly, you scream to Allah for deliverance. The goolehs flee in terror before they can be struck dead. Laughing, you ride off.
[D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
