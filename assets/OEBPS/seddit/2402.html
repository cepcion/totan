<p class="TaleDestiny">(2402) - None</p>
<p>A huge &rsquo;efreet stands before you suddenly and you immediately fall to your knees to beg for your life to be spared. After a long silence, you dare to look up and you see that the&rsquo;efreet is held fast by sparkling bands of power. Rather than feeling pity, you are emboldened to taunt and jab at the helpless creature. Your words and blows do nothing and when the &rsquo;efreet makes even the slightest shift in position, fear grabs hold of you. Better to leave now with some dignity. [D+1]</p>
