<p class="TaleDestiny">(734) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>A swirl of blue flame appears out of nowhere. At the sound of your terror-stricken cry, the cloud of fire forms into a small &rsquo;efreet, who apologizes profusely for frightening you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: All you can do is stammer in terror. Shaking his head, the
&rsquo;efreet dissolves into a cloud of blue flame and disappears. The sight of his body being consumed by flame is more than you can bear to watch.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You quickly and bravely scold him for his rude behavior, causing him to wince in shame. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m terribly sorry. I mean no harm. Please take this as a token of my regret.&rdquo; He gestures and disappears, leaving an interesting item in his wake. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
