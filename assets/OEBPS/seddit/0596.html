<p>Though you were happy to get the slave for almost nothing, his changes of mood and unintelligible babbling are driving you crazy.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have to get rid of him, for already you can feel sanity slipping away. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You realize the slave is under an enchantment and, once you free him of the spell, he becomes a loyal and faithful servant. [D+2 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation / Wisdom]</p>
