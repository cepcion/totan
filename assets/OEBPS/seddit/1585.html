<p class="TaleDestiny">(1585) - FATED  (M),  LUCK</p>
<p>You manage to cling to a piece of driftwood, and survive for many days by catching fish and eating them raw. Long after you have lost track of the days, you see an island in the distance and guide yourself to it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The land is strange and unfamiliar, but at least you are again in the company of humans. [Have another player move you to any island space]</p>
