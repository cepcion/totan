<p class="TaleDestiny">(1985) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, more than anything else, you have decided to explore the bowl of a mighty volcano. You see that you are not the only one, as a pair of figures can be seen across the fiery core. Suddenly, you see one of the figures slip, barely catching himself before he tumbles into the inferno.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There isn&rsquo;t time to run around the entire volcano to reach the man, so you try your. [Lick with some of the tunnels you find. By the time you find a suitable passageway, all that you can do is console the dead man&rsquo;s friend. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You race around the caldera as fast as you can, the heat pulling sweat from you in rivers. There is no possibility to reach the dangling figure from above, but you know that volcanoes are often filled with passages and tunnels. Allah is with you this day, as you quickly find such a tunnel, and arrive just in time to catch the young man as his grip is failing! [D+1 / S+1]</p>
