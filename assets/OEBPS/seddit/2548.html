<p class="TaleDestiny">(2548) - LUCK</p>
<p>While traveling a lonely desert road, you come across the ruins of a caravan which has been destroyed by bandits. In the wreckage, you find only one survivor, an old trader in tattered robes. His legs are shattered, and it is clear he is dying. &ldquo;I spent everything I have to win this bauble,&rdquo; he says, showing you a great ring. &ldquo;But now I will die before bringing it to my mother. I would have you bring her to me.&rdquo; You realize that he will not likely survive long enough for you to complete a round trip, so, despite his protests, you haul him up onto your mount and ride to the nearest town. When you arrive, you quickly find the mother&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you reach the house, the old woman comes running out. She leans in close to her son and they whisper for a moment before he passes. She turns and spits at you, &ldquo;Curse you for moving him. You have killed my son!&rdquo; [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The young man brightens at the sight of his mother. &ldquo;Mother, I have brought you a present!&rdquo; He places something in her hand and then breathes his last. She tosses the object in the dirt. &ldquo;I do not need this horrid prize! I warned you not to seek such blasphemous things!&rdquo; You pick up the object and place it deftly into your pack. [S+1 / Seal Ring]</p>
