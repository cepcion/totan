<p>You are nursed back to health by an accomplished chirurgeon after an ill-fated adventure. Although very talented in medicine, the other is poor at administration. When healing supplies run low, no one in the city can replenish them. The other, who works with the chirurgeon as a guard, asks that you lead a caravan to a certain city and return with new goods. You agree, pleased to help in any way you can. When you arrive, many weeks later, at the far city, you find that the merchant has greatly increased his prices and the gold you were sent with is insufficient.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can supplement the caravan&rsquo;s coffers with your own wealth or not:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you sacrifice a level of Wealth</span>: The other is so impressed with your generosity that he offers to take you as his student of the medical arts. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Scholarship]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not sacrifice a level of Wealth</span>: You return with what you can afford, but the other suspects you of embezzlement. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
