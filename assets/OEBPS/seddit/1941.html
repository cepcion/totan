<p class="TaleDestiny">(1941) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>It is well known that many guards are, at some level, corrupt. Perhaps you can find a guard at the Crystal Palace who will allow you to pass in exchange for some small token?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your clumsy efforts at bribery are met with snorts of derision by the guards. Without ceremony, you are dragged away from the palace and cast into the muddy road. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: With a clever gleam in your eye, you approach a lone guard and strike up a conversation. Once you have his trust, you learn of his desire to court a certain young maiden from the nearby village. In exchange for a suitable courting gift, he agrees to look the other way as you sneak into the palace. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
