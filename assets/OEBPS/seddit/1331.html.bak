<p class="TaleDestiny">(1331) - SEDUCTION, ENSORCELLED  (M)</p>
<p>You pray to Allah for an entrance, and an earthquake brings down one wall of the city. While exploring a palace, you hear, &ldquo;Who comes?&rdquo; and see the most beautiful woman you have ever met. She asks, &ldquo;How dare you enter without knocking?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With a wave of her hand you are outside the city. The wall is repaired, and you depart, thankful that the sorceress did not do worse to you. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: &ldquo;I did it only to find you, oh wondrous one!&rdquo; you reply. She is a powerful enchantress, living in solitude; you lighten her days. [D+2 / S+3 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENSORCELLED  (mandatory):</span> You find yourself impelled by the enchantment laid on your mind, and attack her immediately. The woman, a sorceress, responds by dousing you with a handful of water, and muttering, &ldquo;Quit this form and take that of a dog!&rdquo; You feel yourself changing, but quickly spring to the table and lap up some of the enchanted water from her silver basin. When she transforms herself into a serpent, you turn yourself into a mighty eagle, then spring upon her and throttle her with your claws. She becomes a huge lion, and with a thought you are an elephant, crushing her beneath your feet. The sorceress then takes on the form of a roc, and opens her tremendous beak to eat you whole&mdash;whereupon you become a dendan and overwhelm her by sheer size. Then she becomes a red flame and you become a blue flame and the two of you burn until, at the last, your ensorcellment is shattered and you cry out the name of Allah. Your flame burns like the sun and you destroy the enchantress. You return to your own form, badly burned and dying, but comforted by the sight of the city around you returning to life, freed from her dread spell. [Death]</p>
