<p class="TaleDestiny">(1084) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You have been told of a nearby valley full of fabulous diamonds. You hire a band of seedy-looking men (the best you can find in this region) to aid you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You throw a carcass into the valley. A giant vulture lifts the carcass back to the valley wall to feed. You drive the vulture away from the carcass, which has several diamonds sticking in it, but your companions thrash you and abscond with the diamonds that were rightly yours! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You tell the Sultan of your expedition, and offer half of the proceeds to him. He sends his most trusted guards to control your helpers. Your profits earn the Sultan&rsquo;s favor. [D+2 / S+1 / W+5 (Max: Fabulous) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
