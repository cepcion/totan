<p>You pray to Allah for guidance. Arising from prayer, your attention is drawn to a single leaf floating down the river. Suddenly a fish bursts from beneath the water and eats the leaf.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You take this as a sign of danger, and move on. [S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You have seen this before in your travels; you are unimpressed. You set out on the river in a small boat, and a fish as big as a house grabs your boat in its teeth and swims away. You hang on in desperation, terrified of being eaten. The fish swims for a night and a day, then tosses your boat on a strange and unknown shore. [D+1 / S+2 / W-1
(Min: Respectable) / Have another player move you to any coastal or sea space]</p>
