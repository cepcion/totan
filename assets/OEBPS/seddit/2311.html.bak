<p class="TaleDestiny">(2311) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You have been hired to retrieve a man from a gang of bandits. Your new employer told you where and when to best find your target.  That very night, you creep up to the gang&rsquo;s campfire, where you see a seated figure: the person who hired you!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You freeze in confusion as the man turns to you and smiles. You then find a scimitar across your throat: the trap he set has closed upon you! Fortunately, he is so amused by his own skill that he lets you off easily. [D-1 / S-1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: It would have been a perfect trap&mdash;if you hadn&rsquo;t recognized the person hiring you as himself a renowned thief. Your &ldquo;target&rdquo; smiles, expecting the trap to close shut right about now, but the thug whom he expected to come up behind you was waylaid by a pit you dug out earlier. You casually saunter forward toward the thief, his smile vanishing. [D+1 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
