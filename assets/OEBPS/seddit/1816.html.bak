<p class="TaleDestiny">(1816) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You are traveling through a region that lately has been plagued by snakes of all sizes and types. The people would doubtless be grateful if you could find some way to rid them of this scourge.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You remember passing by a caravan from the Islands of Camphor recently. The merchant tried to sell you some snake-repelling oil from that region. It costs you a fair amount of money, but you are able to purchase enough oil to aid the locals. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You know of a certain guru who makes his home high on a rugged pinnacle of rock. He is said to have knowledge of all the creatures that crawl on their bellies. It is a difficult and arduous journey to the hermit&rsquo;s pillar, but you finally reach him. He obliges you to join him in a month-long fast before revealing his secret knowledge of keeping snakes at bay. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
