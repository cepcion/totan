<p class="TaleDestiny">(1803) - LUCK</p>
<p>The pearl beds here are renowned throughout the world for the size and quality of the pearls that can be found. You venture to try the art yourself. It proves more difficult than you expect, and soon, your lungs burning for air, you surge towards the surface. But as you rise, your foot is caught in the ragged coral! Fighting panic, you struggle to break free, the pain in your lungs growing greater every moment. When you cannot stand it any longer, your heart screams a prayer to the All-Merciful!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A moment later your vision fades. You awaken on the shore, with no memory of how you came to be there. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: With a mighty pull, you wrench your leg free and discover that it was not the coral, but the strap of a leather bag that had entrapped you. Pulling it to the surface, you realize that it is a saddlebag of exotic workmanship! Praise Allah! [D+1 / S+1 / Magic Saddlebags]</p>
