<p class="TaleDestiny">(2492) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>While visiting an inn, you end up in conversation with a group of fellow travelers, sharing tales of some of your adventurers. When you are ready to depart, the other stands up abruptly and bars your path. &ldquo;You have been overly familiar with the one I love, and are drawing her into a path of corruption and immorality!&rdquo; Not wishing to be bothered with this lovesick fool, you cuff him soundly, sending him sprawling.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As the patrons drag the unfortunate one out into the street, the innkeeper apologizes profusely but asks you to go before there is further trouble. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You draw your sword and stand over the humbled other. You tell him that if he wishes to fight, perhaps he should focus his energies at something more useful than fleeting affections. Instead of jealous fits and poorly executed attacks, he should devote himself to service to the needy. Inspired, he gathers his things and leaves that very night. The innkeeper will have no further trouble from him. [D+1 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
