<p class="TaleDestiny">(914) - WILDERNESS LORE, ENDURING HARDSHIP, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>When you came to this area, the local villagers told you stories of the haunting creatures which dwelled by this river. Scoffing at danger, you agree to find the beasts and track them to their lair, but now you watch as black alligators emerge from the river and rise to their hind legs, their forms beginning to soften and shift. They can be nothing but deeply evil. Mercifully, you are not seen in your hiding place.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are so scared by what you have seen that you cannot follow through on your promise. You return to the nearby village to admit your failure. They mock you for your cowardice and lack of sense.
[S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, ENDURING HARDSHIP, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You resolve to track these dark beings and observe them carefully. Though it is dangerous, you follow them to their lair, and make careful notes to assure that you can find your way back. You return to the village, and lead the grateful people to the lair, that they may rid themselves of these evil creatures. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
