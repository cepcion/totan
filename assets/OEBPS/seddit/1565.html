<p class="TaleDestiny">(1565) - LUCK</p>
<p>Your victim stands his ground and defends himself valiantly. Nonetheless, you overcome him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You escape, but of course you are sought by the Sultan&rsquo;s guards for your crimes. [D+1 / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: After your escape, another person is captured, and despite his protests, is sentenced in your stead. The innocent one is to hang. You cannot let him die for your crime&mdash;you come forward and confess. The Sultan is impressed with your courage; he pardons you and engages you to catch other criminals. [D+3 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
