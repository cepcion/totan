<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You patiently insist that the other listen to you as you tell him the Tale of the Vengeful Camel and What Befell Him. He considers your tale carefully, then praises you before the Merciful God for showing him the error of his ways. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
