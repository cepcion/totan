<p class="TaleDestiny">(1948) - BLESSED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>When you unexpectedly discover the wondrous Graveyard of the Elephants, you are overwhelmed and immediately drop to your knees to praise Allah for his generosity.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is so much ivory here that you could never hope to carry more than a small portion of it. Gathering what you can, you make your way back to civilization. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">BLESSED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You realize that it was the will of Allah that you find this trove of ivory. Would He not also aid you in returning to the city with a small portion of the wealth? Building a make-shift sled, you drag along as much ivory as you can. For many arduous days you cross the jungle, but the Ever-Generous guides your steps and protects you from dangers. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Piety]</p>
