<p class="TaleDestiny">(211) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You profess your love for the other in glowing phrases. Finally, the other says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I&rsquo;m not sure I wish to marry you. You talk too much.&rdquo; The other launches into a lengthy and exhausting argument with himself over your virtues and failings, and never allows you to speak a word in your own defense.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Finally, he concludes that you would make a fine spouse, but you are no longer sure you wish to be married. You are wed, and each day is a living hell until the divorce. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You realize that you have no desire to be wed to this chattering creature, so you wisely point out all your own flaws in great detail. The other refuses the marriage. [D+2 / Quick Thinking]
