<p>The other speaks without looking at you. &ldquo;You exceed the bounds of polite company, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Now, please leave my sight.&rdquo; [Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES (if same sex)</span>: You persist, and your words and poems convince the other that you are one of breeding and taste. You dine together and discourse on literary matters and court gossip. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship / Courtly Graces]</p>

You smile, and he drops to his knees and begs you never to take your beauty from him. You bid him rise while you consider his suit, for truly he is most attractive, with a countenance as bright as the summer stars and movements as graceful as an eagle in flight. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
