<p class="TaleDestiny">(532) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You see one you hate for his past injustices to your family.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You leap forward and bring death to him. Only then do you realize that he is not who you thought&mdash;he was an innocent beggar. You are wracked with remorse and pledge to undertake a pilgrimage to cleanse yourself. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">On Pilgrimage</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: As you prepare to remove his head from his shoulders, you see that the other is in disguise, and is not the one you are looking for. You realize that you should be sure of all the facts before you act. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
