<p class="TaleDestiny">(1196) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Prince Taj el Mulouk has fallen in love with Dunya, the daughter of the King of the Camphor Islands, but Dunya spurns his love poems, for she is said to be averse to men.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot discover the reason for Dunya&rsquo;s dislike of men, and cannot aid the young prince. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, QUICK THINKING</span>: Disguised as an old wise-woman, you converse with Dunya to learn her thoughts. She tells you of her dream: &ldquo;A male dove caught by a fowler&rsquo;s net was aided by a female, but when the female was caught, the male dove did not help. This shows the worthlessness of males.&rdquo; You report this to the prince, and he praises you for your aid. He then asks your advice on making her see that men are not without virtue.
