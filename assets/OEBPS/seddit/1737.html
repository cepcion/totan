<p class="TaleDestiny">(1737) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Heading towards the center of the island, you stumble into a band of apes who quickly begin chasing you! Your breath comes in ragged gasps as you tumble down a forest slope, the loping beasts just a few feet behind you. At the bottom of the hill, you splash into a quick-flowing river.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The current drags you under as you struggle to gulp a breath of air. Some hours later, you awaken on the riverbank. Looking around, you see no sign of your pursuers, and you thank Allah for aiding your escape. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You see a low-hanging branch stretching from the other side of the river. Calling upon every ounce of energy you have, you swim desperately towards it, grabbing hold at the last second before the current carries you away. Allah truly is generous! [D+1 / Luck]</p>
