<p class="TaleDestiny">(2495) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You meet another in a busy market street. You begin to converse, and you learn that the other is of noble birth but has been cast out of the ancestral home for being too talkative (imagine that!). You learn of the other&rsquo;s hopes and dreams, neighbors and friends, principles and concerns. You cannot get a word in edgewise. Finally you decide that if you are ever to be rid of this friendly but talkative pest, you must help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You finally cut the garrulous one off. You explain that actions are needed now, not words. The other thanks you mightily but then launches into another tale. You realize this is a hopeless cause, and you turn your back on the other. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You decide that what this young person needs is lessons in self-restraint. You teach the other that the best approach for a noble is laconic. Over time, and after countless interruptions, the youth begins to understand. The two of you return to the ancestral home and the family is delighted in the change in their scion. The family bestows on you a royal mark. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
