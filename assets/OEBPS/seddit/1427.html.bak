<p>You come upon him and defeat him easily.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you are looting his body, a shadow looms over you. The one you defeated was a servant sent to test you. The master remains yet to be faced!</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may surrender to the master or fight:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you surrender</span>: You bow down and ask how you can serve him, and he demands you take the place of the slain servant. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you fight</span>: When the master comes, you draw your sword and face him.</li>
<ul>
<li class="TaleRoll2D MidSubTaleSkill" style="list-style-type:none;">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Weapon Use</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Luck</span>:</span></li>

<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: The master is most powerful and skilled, and cruelly thrashes you, leaving you bleeding near to death. [D+1 / Lose Appearance / Lose Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: Though the master is most skillful, you fend him off until a twist of fortune gains you a second&rsquo;s advantage. You seize the chance and flee. [D+2 / S+2 / Luck]</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You realize that the other you have defeated is merely a servant sent to test you. You quickly don his robes and muffle your face. When the master comes, your report that you have slain your foe, and actually receive a reward! [D+2 / S+1 / W+1
