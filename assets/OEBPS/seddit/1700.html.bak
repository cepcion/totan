<p>For the last two days you have been tracking this elephant, a magnificent bull with some of the finest tusks you have ever seen. You follow it to the edge of a mist-enshrouded forest. You are about to plunge into the shadowy undergrowth when your native guide stops you. &ldquo;No, master, it is forbidden!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Shrugging off the simple superstitions of the savage, you seize your spear and disappear into the trees. You remember seeing great moving shapes in the darkness. You remember following the elephant to the edge of a great tumbled ruin. You even remember scaling the steps to what you believe was an ancient temple or shrine. Somehow you are glad that you cannot remember entering the ruin, or how you escaped the forest, your clothes torn and weapons lost. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Heeding your guide&rsquo;s advice, you search the edge of the forest and discover a long abandoned marker stone. Cleaning off the encroaching vines, you realize that it shows the way to a long-lost place of untold riches! [D+1 / S+1 / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0180.html#TaleHeader">Valley of Diamonds</a>]</p>
