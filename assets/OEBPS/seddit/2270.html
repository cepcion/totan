<p class="TaleDestiny">(2270) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>When you have finished administering your punishment, your victim eagerly follows you, wishing to be of service to you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot shake him and his constant ravings drive you from sanity! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You have pity on the poor wretch, who is obviously demented rather than truly evil. You take the other under your wing, and through much patience and understanding, you bring him back to just enough sensibility to again be part of society. [D+2 / S+2 / Scholarship / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
