<p class="TaleDestiny">(1671) - QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You are approached by someone quite attractive, who unbidden, takes your arm and strolls aside you, speaking words of undying love. Before you can even speak, a mighty jinni appears before you and accuses you of having stolen his lover. &ldquo;Arm yourself and prepare to die!&rdquo; the other cries.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your head swimming, you draw a blade and take a stance. The jinni laughs at the sight of you, clearly outmatched, and has mercy&mdash;merely breaking your arm rather than your spine&mdash;before departing with his reluctant human prize. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: Instead of drawing your blade, you pull the beautiful human close and smother her with kisses. The jinni grows wroth, but you say, &ldquo;Never does the path of true love waver, even unto death! This is my beloved, and you cannot take her from me!&rdquo; The jinni is amazed by your bravery and swears to leave you to your true heart. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
