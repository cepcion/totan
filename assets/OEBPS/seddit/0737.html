<p class="TaleDestiny">(737) - SCHOLARSHIP, STORYTELLING, ENSORCELLED  (M)</p>
<p>You and the crew struggle to wrest the ship from the grasp of the whirlpool, but your ears are filled with a strange high song, calling you forward to your doom. You cannot resist their lure.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, STORYTELLING</span>: You recognize the call of the sirens from the old tales. Plugging the ears of the crewmen, you bind yourself to the mast that you might hear the siren&rsquo;s song. The crew, protected from the song, brings the ship through safely. [D+2 / S+2 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p><p><span class="TaleSkill">ENSORCELLED  (mandatory):</span> Alas, your magically befuddled state prevents you from recognizing the siren&rsquo;s calls for what they are. For a moment the two enchantments war, but the stress is too much for you. As the lure of the sweetly singing voices destroys your reason, the powerful enchantment gripping your mind erodes your wisdom, until finally both lose their hold on you, their battleground&mdash;your mind&mdash;forever vanished. [Death]</p>
