<p class="TaleDestiny">(2588) - BEGUILING, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>A wealthy merchant asks you to track down a wandering order of dervishes. The man is dying and wishes the holy ones to bless him before he passes. He promises suitable payment for their devotions and for your aid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The leader of the dervishes refuses your request. The blessings of the order are not for sale. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Knowing that a direct offer of payment would simply insult the holy ones, you attempt a different approach. You indicate that the group can secure a generous offer to a nearby mosque if they can find the grace in their hearts to pray over a dying man. Surely, Allah would approve of such devotion. The dervishes accept. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 use)]</p>
