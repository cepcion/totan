<p class="TaleDestiny">(657) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>At the sound of your voice the waters seethe and roil. With a burst of spray, a gooleh emerges! &ldquo;Woe unto you for disturbing me at my bath!&rdquo; she cries.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You scrabble away on all fours, howling and bereft of reason. Your miserable life is saved only by the timely intervention of the Sultan&rsquo;s hunting party. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You beg forgiveness and explain that you were trying to warn her of the approach of the Sultan&rsquo;s hunting party.
