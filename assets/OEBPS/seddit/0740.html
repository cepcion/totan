<p class="TaleDestiny">(740) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>A merman appears and hails you. &ldquo;Welcome, travelers. It appears you&rsquo;ll be joining me shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Chuckling merrily, he dives. You trade looks of puzzlement with the other passengers&hellip; until you hear the roar of the whirlpool at your bow, and all becomes clear. You cry out as the ship is drawn in and bursts upon the rocks, and you barely manage to swim to safety. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Beggar) / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Before the merman can slip away, you greet him courteously and ask him the significance of his jest. Your manners cause him to regret his uncouth joke, and he warns you of the whirlpool up ahead. Forewarned, you easily avoid the danger, and sail on. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
