<p class="TaleDestiny">(1544) - STEALTH AND STEALING, LUCK</p>
<p>Your words falter as you finally get a good look at your jailor. You turn away quickly, involuntarily: never have you seen one whose visage was so horrid that it would frighten small children and make women faint. The jailor begins to weep and walks away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You find no words to comfort the jailor as he disappears into the darkness. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING, LUCK</span>: As the jailor turns to go, you are able to grab the keys: the jailor&rsquo;s weeping prevents him from noticing the theft. When he is gone, you are free. [D+1 / Stealth and Stealing / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
