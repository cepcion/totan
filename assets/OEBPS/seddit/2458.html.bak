<p class="TaleDestiny">(2458) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Wandering through the woods without direction, you find a clearing. There you discover a black-furred creature, ensnared in some huntsman&rsquo;s trap! Unable to bear such suffering, you attempt to free the creature.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The huntsman appears just as you release the animal. He demands compensation for your having stolen his prey. You graciously offer him a reward. Softened by your kindness, he offers to guide you on your way.
[S+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: You free the creature from the trap and release it. But for days afterwards it follows you, entranced by your kindness and beauty. You learn much of the art of stalking by watching the soundless passage of the creature. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
