<p class="TaleDestiny">(1825) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>After that insult, you have no choice but to challenge your rival to a duel to the death. You are lead by your second to a secluded oasis. Your rival invites you to take a cooling drink before the battle so the fight will be fair.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You drink deeply from the cool, sweet waters of the spring. To your amazement, your reflection in the water changes! Your gender has been reversed! You look to your treacherous rival to discover an identical transformation taking place. &ldquo;You fool! The curse could not be lifted until I tricked another into drinking from the spring. Now I am free at last!&rdquo; You see to it that the rogue dies free. [S+1 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Distrustful of your foe, you refuse the offer and prepare for the duel. Seeing that the ploy was discovered, your rival drops down and begs you for your mercy, revealing the plan to trick you into drinking so you too would suffer a change of sex. Disgusted by the groveling, you leave the miserable wretch to suffer. [D+1]</p>
