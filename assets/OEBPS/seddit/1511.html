<p class="TaleDestiny">(1511) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You try to soften the heart of your jailor with tales of familial woes. You plead to be with them lest their fate be doomed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Even the wicked have a soft spot. Your tales remind him of his family and their troubles. [Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Your tales of woe are too perfect&mdash;outlandish at times&mdash;and the jailor recognizes what you are trying (too hard) to do. He turns a deaf ear to further pleadings. [S-1]</p>
