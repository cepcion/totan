<p>Absorbed in his devotions, the other is easily taken. You press him for his knowledge.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He refuses to speak and cannot be intimidated, for he has no fear of this world and is sure in his faith in the Merciful God. [D+2 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: He is unwise in the ways of the world, and easily tricked into revealing information. Before he realizes what he has done, he tells you of the route to a hidden place of great interest. When you have the information you seek, you hastily depart, his vow to avenge your trickery fading in the distance. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> / Have another player move you to any Place of Power and have an immediate encounter]</p>
