<p>In this place, the Sultan&rsquo;s herds are plagued by a hungry lion. He proposes that you capture the noble beast that it may be displayed at his court. You agree, both for the Sultan&rsquo;s sake and for the sake of the lion.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You lead several soldiers and lay a trap for the beast. But the lion surprises and mauls you. To save your life, the soldiers are forced to slay the beast, and your plan is blamed for its destruction. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You wisely observe to the Sultan that protection of his herds is proper, but keeping one of Allah&rsquo;s most noble beasts in captivity is a sin of pride. The Sultan is moved by your words. With your leadership, the lion is captured, carried far away, and released. The Sultan makes you his trusted advisor. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
