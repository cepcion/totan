<p class="TaleDestiny">(1947) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>The gibbering sounds made by the naked primitives who captured you might be a language, but it is unlike any you have ever heard. You pray to the All-Merciful that you have not fallen into the hands of cannibals.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It appears that the natives do not intend to eat you, but the fate they have in mind is still unpleasant. You are carried to the edge of a deep pit filled with the bones from generations of dead elephants! The natives toss you into the pit and leave you for dead. Fortunately, the elephant remains soften your fall, and you are not hurt too badly to escape. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: You can only guess that your grace and royal bearing have convinced the natives that you are some kind of deity. You are carried to the edge of the fabled Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. There you are placed upon a handcrafted throne, and jewelry made from fine ivory is placed about your neck. You humor the natives for a while, then pretend to get angry. They scatter like frightened rabbits, and you happily take their ivory with you. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
