<p class="TaleDestiny">(1333) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Your prayers reveal a hidden entrance. Within the walls, you find people still live! They are few, and fearful, saying, &ldquo;We will not open the gates until the Sultan promised by Allah appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are humbled by their faith and depart. [D+2 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: They look closely at you and gasp. &ldquo;This is the one!&rdquo; They pull you before a statue, which verily is like to your image in a mirror! Bells peal, people dance in the street, and the gates burst open!
[D+3 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
