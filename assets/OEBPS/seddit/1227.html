<p class="TaleDestiny">(1227) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You wish to try your luck at pearl-diving, but you require a guide and diving companion. You select a fellow, but another warns you against the first and suggests himself instead. The first &ldquo;guide&rdquo; loudly warns against the second.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot decide. Rather than make the wrong choice, you simply give up on the idea of diving. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: By a simple riddle, you determine which is the more trustworthy. With his aid and guidance, you are able to snatch three beautiful black pearls from the jaws of the giant oysters. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)]</p>
