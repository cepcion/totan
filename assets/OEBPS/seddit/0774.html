<p class="TaleDestiny">(774) - None</p>
<p>Things have gone horribly wrong. You think upon the stories of great sailors you&rsquo;ve heard from the minstrels and try to emulate their skills to help the helmsman avoid a terrible whirlpool. The currents around this danger are unusual, and you know not which way to go. You call upon Allah to guide your hands.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Seamanship</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wilderness Lore</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: You try to sail out of the whirlpool, but it is too powerful. The ship is wrecked, and you are cast up on a distant shore. [S+2 / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: You triumph against the whirlpool! You succeed in saving the ship and all who are on it. The Master of the Ship makes you captain. [D+1 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Seamanship / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
</ul>
