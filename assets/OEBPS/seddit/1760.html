<p class="TaleDestiny">(1760) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>This being your first visit to the Islands of Camphor, you decide to explore the famous laurel forests that lend the islands their name.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: While you are enjoying the beauty of the forests, you are fortunate enough to encounter the Sultan&rsquo;s own master gardener. You find him an amazing individual, very learned in many subjects. You spend many joyous days in his company, and finally depart with a much broader understanding of the cosmos. [D+1 / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: During your wanderings, you chance upon some interesting tracks. You follow them through difficult terrain for many hours before you finally spot a most magnificent gazelle. She is splendid in form, the finest you have ever seen. You stand mesmerized by the beauty of the creature for a moment before she notices you. You are struck by the sadness and intelligence you see in her eyes.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not have Magic</span>: You cannot bring your heart to harm such a wondrous creature. You let her go and continue your wanderings. [D+1 / S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you have Magic</span>: You realize that the gazelle is a human, somehow cursed with an animal form! Fortunately, you happen to have collected some medicinal herbs earlier in the day that can cure her condition! As you hold out the herbs,  she approaches gingerly and eats from your hand. The spell is broken, and a beautiful youth is revealed! [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if you are not Married)]</li>
