<p class="TaleDestiny">(776) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>The legend of giant oysters containing giant pearls is one told far and wide. This time you think the sailor telling you the tale is telling the truth. There is a ship that will be coming through a remote passage on its way into the harbor with a load of these pearls and you could help to waylay the ship and seize the treasure.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other sets you up as the patsy for the attack. When questions are asked about the missing ship back in the harbor, you are blamed and the other and his crew get away. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You overhear the other telling members of the crew that you are going to be the patsy for this job. You decide to double-cross them. As the other ship approaches the passage you secret away to signal them of the attack. The other ship is ready for your erstwhile allies and you help from your side to overtake the pirates. You are greatly rewarded by the owner of the diving ship. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
