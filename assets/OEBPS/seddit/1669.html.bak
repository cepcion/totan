<p class="TaleDestiny">(1669) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M), APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Through an amazing set of circumstances, the other has become quite attached to you, but unfortunately, is quite the ugliest creature in this or any world. After spending some effort to spurn his advances, you become fed up and lash out. You tell him to never return, or else you will be forced to take more dramatic measures.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> He sulks away, distraught. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other swears that the only way to be free of the memory of your lovely form is to take it from you! A few words from the jinni and you stand before your own mirror image&mdash;and the other stands before his own! You scuttle away in fear. [<span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
