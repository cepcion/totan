<p class="TaleDestiny">(1684) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You come across a scholar and the other deep in debate. They dispute whether Allah has one name, infinitely many, or whether such a question can even be answered within the bounds of the world. &ldquo;Learned sages,&rdquo; you interrupt, &ldquo;I have wisdom even you lack.&rdquo; They pause. You launch into a torrent of parlor tricks (starting with the ever popular &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a coin behind your ear!&rdquo;) and simple jokes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are met only by deep silence. The sages are not amused by your antics and go back to their debate. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: They are mightily amused by your show and invite you back to entertain for a greater crowd later. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
