<p class="TaleDestiny">(313) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cries the youth. &ldquo;I am pursued by guards of my lover&rsquo;s father! If they catch me they shall beat me to within an inch of my life!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot help the other, and as he flees, you are deeply saddened. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You quickly conceive a plan to aid the other. As the runaway dashes off, you shout to the guards, &ldquo;I have seen the one you chase. For a coin I&rsquo;ll show you where he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo; After receiving the payment, you lead the guards on a merry chase, then lose them. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Quick Thinking]</p>
