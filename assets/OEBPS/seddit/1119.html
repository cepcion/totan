<p class="TaleDestiny">(1119) - WISDOM, INSANE  (M)</p>
<p>The sun makes you dizzy from heat, so you go to a grove of trees for shade. Behind the trees a misty city shimmers. Thinking it a mirage, you wander its streets, marveling that the people cannot see you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Later, when recounting this experience, your audience is impressed. [S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You realize it is real&mdash;a city caught between your world and another. You converse with a sage from another time and learn fabulous things. [D+2 / S+2 / Scholarship / Opportunity to enter any <a href="PlacesofPower.html">Place of Power</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory):</span> Unencumbered by sanity, your intellect is able to embrace the paradoxes involved, and you realize the true nature of the misty city. In the blinding flash of inspiration which accompanies this realization, you understand that you will never be able to convey its meaning to your fellow mortals. You decide, therefore, to go and dwell in the city, and each day the city itself is more and more real, even as the world you left behind fades, until at last you have become one of the most respected citizens of the mirage kingdom. The concerns of the world become like unto a mere story, one you heard long ago and of which you cannot recall the details. [Death]</p>
