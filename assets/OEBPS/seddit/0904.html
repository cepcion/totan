<p class="TaleDestiny">(904) - MAGIC</p>
<p>As it grazes, the creature utters low sounds like the cries of lost souls. Despite your resolve, you fearfully keep your distance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is little to be learned from such a remove. After a short time the beast starts in alarm, and is gone before you can follow. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: By its signs, you know it to be a human in beast form. With a blessing and a magical sign, you remove the enchantment.
