<p class="TaleDestiny">(1235) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>While sleeping beneath a tree, you dream of wild natives poking you in the ribs with spears. Suddenly you wake to find a huge rhinoceros prodding you curiously with his horn. You cannot decide whether to panic, slash out with your sword, or make your peace with the Most High.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your body decides for you: you faint from fear. When you awake, the rhino is walking slowly away. Were it a human, you would swear it was chuckling. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, QUICK THINKING</span>: You pray for delivery, but the rhino charges you! You leap to your feet, shouting, and with a graceful jump you swing into the branches of the tree. Moving too fast to stop, the rhinoceros slams his horn into the tree&mdash;and becomes stuck! It is now a simple matter to dispatch the beast and sell its carcass. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Piety]</p>
