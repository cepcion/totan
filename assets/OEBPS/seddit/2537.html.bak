<p class="TaleDestiny">(2537) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Looking up at an abandoned temple, you see a crazy man jumping up and down on the slippery dome. You call to him, warning him of the danger. Although panting and clearly exhausted, he does not stop. He claims that Allah wishes him to dance, so dance he will.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A wise man does not come between another man and Allah. You move on with nothing but a strange tale to tell. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You can think of nothing that will convince this fool to cease, so you climb up and dance with him. Maybe Allah will gaze upon the two of you and have pity on this poor restless man. After three days and nights, Allah returns the man&rsquo;s senses and he is freed of his affliction. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
