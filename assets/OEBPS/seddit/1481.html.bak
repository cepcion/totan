<p>Determined to give the other time to cool his anger, you decide to offer to guide him through a &ldquo;shortcut.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After some hours of wandering, the other quits your company to make his own way. Your delay proves fruitful and the would-be victim of his vengeance is spared for another day. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: Leading the other deep into the wilderness, you abandon him just before he becomes suspicious. You return to civilization well before he does and warn his intended victim, the beautiful daughter of a powerful merchant, who rewards you handsomely. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Fabulous)]</p>
