<p class="TaleDestiny">(2016) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>A family of starving monsters, lead by a powerful gooleh, surrounds your camp. &ldquo;Although it is against Allah&rsquo;s law, we cannot contain our desires, and you must be sacrificed to sustain us.&rdquo; Noting her air of civilization, you question their intentions and ask for a few moments to present an alternative.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: At her command, the pack listens to your entreaties. Your proposal is met with indifference, but the gooleh appreciates the attempt to address their needs. She halts the group before they consume you entirely. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You detail a secluded valley that you&rsquo;ve heard about, far from any soldier&rsquo;s patrols. This vale is bountiful in water and animals, including a rare deer whose flesh tastes just like human. You suggest that the family journey to this place and live free from sin and danger. The gooleh is moved and commends your wisdom and knowledge. [D+2 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
