<p class="TaleDestiny">(1858) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The disgusting creature dared to touch your fine robes! Certainly a good beating will teach him his place!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You land blow after blow on the sniveling form, but somehow it reaches out to touch your bare skin. You feel&hellip; different. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: As you are about to deliver a fine beating, you realize that the rags worn by the other were once fine silks! Your heart turns to mercy and, after long conversations you learn of the miserable other&rsquo;s unfortunate fate. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: As you begin to vent your anger on the other, you recognize him as a wanted pirate! Seizing him by the neck, you deliver him to the magistrate for the reward. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)</p>
