<p class="TaleDestiny">(2521) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>While you are watering your horse at a small village well, a man dressed in fine robes demands to know your name. He claims to be the local magistrate and accuses you of stealing water from the Sultan&rsquo;s personal well. Apologizing, you beg for forgiveness. The man laughs heartily and asks why you should be spared. You offer to pay for the water you have taken so that it will not be stealing. Eyes averted and thoroughly frightened, you do not notice that his grooming does not match his finery.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Pulling out your most valued object, you see the man&rsquo;s eyes light up. You reluctantly hand over your prize. During the next few days, you begin to wonder and ask about the magistrate. The only response is: &ldquo;What magistrate?&rdquo; [S+1 / Lose one Treasure or W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You sift through your many treasures and come across an old ring that you intended to sell at first chance. You pull it out of your bag, treating it as if it were made of spun silver, and extend it carefully upward so as to catch the sun. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; you say with a touch of awe in your voice,&rdquo; belonged to a great and powerful sheik. It is said that in the right hands, this ring can raise the dead.&rdquo; The magistrate takes the ring, saying, &ldquo;That will do. You may go.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
