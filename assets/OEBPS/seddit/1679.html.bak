<p class="TaleDestiny">(1679) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You see a traveling show that advertises as its main attraction a terrifying monster. Snooping around, you discover that the &ldquo;monster&rdquo; is nothing less than a mighty jinni, held captive by many strange emblems and powerful names carved on its cage. The pain evident in the jinni&rsquo;s face moves you to tears and you swear to free it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You sneak over to the cage, but are discovered. The players beat you mercilessly, but just as you lose consciousness, you break the boards on one side of the cage. When you come to, battered and bruised, the jinni is gone, as are all the players, and you have no idea where you are. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, WEAPON USE</span>: You charge the cage and fend the handlers off long enough for the jinni to break its bonds. You gain a lesson in the powers of the jinni as you watch it make short work of its former captors. [D+1 / S+1 / Magic]</p>
