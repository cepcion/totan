<p class="TaleDestiny">(1872) - MAGIC  (M), SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You find the other sitting in a corner, rocking back and forth and muttering in tongues. You try to make out some of what he is saying.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Whatever he is saying, you don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a real language. But his voice is soothing and you soon doze off to a sleep filled with vivid dreams that make fascinating tales. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC  (mandatory):</span> You understand just enough of what he is saying to know that they should never have been said! The Invisible City! The empty sands! Your mind reels as his rambling reveals hidden secrets none were meant to know. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
