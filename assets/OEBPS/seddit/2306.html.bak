<p>Listening to the other you find him quite wise&hellip; until you realize that he is planning a grand swindle for which you will be blamed! You take no time for questions&mdash;you attack!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is surprisingly agile and tosses you into a nearby river. You cannot swim and soon you feel that you are going to drown. Before you lose consciousness, hands begin to grab you and draw you down to the bottom of the sea. [D+1 / Seamanship / Weapon Use / Move to the <a href="0181.html#TaleHeader">Undersea Kingdom</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other is surprisingly agile and almost bests you. But your experience allows you to get the upper hand at the last moment and toss the other into the nearby river. You declare what you have done to all who gather to watch the struggle, and at your words they suggest that you keep the other&rsquo;s possessions. [S+1 / Treasure]</p>
