<p class="TaleDestiny">(1716) - None</p>
<p>You wandered perhaps a bit too close to the palace of glass, and find yourself cast into a crystal dungeon. The grim faces of the guards tell you that your fate is dire. Knowing that your fate is already in the hands of the Almighty, you resort to prayer.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Piety</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Luck</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2: At dawn you are dragged into the courtyard. As you are forced to your knees, your executioner draws a sword of solid gold and prepares to strike off your head. In your final moments, the transcendent beauty of it all&mdash;palace, sword, even the graceful arc of blood from your neck&mdash;overwhelms you with bliss. [Death]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">3&ndash;5: The cruel king has you broken upon the rack before sending you away. [<span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">6&ndash;10: The evil king orders his guards to beat you for your impudence. [<span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">11+: Late in the night, one of the tyrant&rsquo;s imprisoned children sneaks into your cell to help you escape. [D+1 / S+2]</li>
