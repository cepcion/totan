<p class="TaleDestiny">(993) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A grinning ne&rsquo;er-do-well asks you to lend a hand with a shell game. He tells you which shell the pea will be under so you can &ldquo;guess&rdquo; correctly. Onlookers will believe this game is easy and wager many coins on it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You perform your role well and make a tidy sum. However, a burly man who was taken for many coins tracks you down and teaches you charity and honesty at the end of a stout stick. [D+1 / Lose Stealth and Stealing / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Eventually, the crowd tires of being swindled, and several angry men come for you. Your partner is caught and punished, but you were disguised, and with your clothing changed, none recognize you. You make a tidy profit. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
