<p class="TaleDestiny">(2317) - BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>Seeing as the &rsquo;efreet is an intelligent being, perhaps reasoning will resolve this situation.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The &rsquo;efreet ignores your words as if you were a worm and proceeds to exact his vengeance. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: Your words penetrate the haze of hatred surrounding the &rsquo;efreet. He listens intently and finally he says, &ldquo;I see that your intentions were not of a malicious nature and therefore I forgive you.&rdquo; The &rsquo;efreet vanishes in a cloud of smoke, leaving you unharmed. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
