<p class="TaleDestiny">(1788) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>In the distance you see a great many birds circling. Venturing closer, you discover a great palace and a kindly old man in communion with many birds from all over the world. The old man is none other than Shaykh Nasr, chosen by Solomon himself to be lord over all the creatures of the air. Once per twelvemonth he summons a great Parliament of the Fowls that he might learn about the world.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Ever kind and generous, Nasr permits you to sit and observe, and you learn many secrets of the world beyond your imagining. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: As you sit in quiet observation, you notice a tumult amongst some of the assembled while Nasr is involved with some important business with the hawks. You decide to investigate the tumult yourself, and see if you can settle the issue.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Quick Thinking</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Scholarship</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Fated</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Blessed</span>, and two for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Courtly Graces at Master level</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;5: You make matters worse, and as a result you cause a conflict between the birds of the north and the south! [D-2 / S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">6&ndash;12: You manage to settle the affair with only a few feathers ruffled. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">13+: You bring both sides around to your way of seeing. So fair and wise is your solution to their dilemma, word quickly spreads through the Parliament of your deeds. You shall forever more be a friend to all bird-kind. Each bird in attendance grants you a single feather to fashion a glorious robe. [D+2 / S+1 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</li>
