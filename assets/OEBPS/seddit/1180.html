<p class="TaleDestiny">(1180) - None</p>
<p>You take a lifeboat and fish at some distance from your vessel. Suddenly a dendan appears, making for the ship. You have heard that the shout of a human can kill a dendan. You cry out to Allah and, if prayer doesn&rsquo;t work, you also draw your sword.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Luck</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: The dendan must not have heard you, for it is not slain. You are swallowed and finally spat up on a distant shore. You should have put more faith in your prayers than your sword. [D+1 / S+1 / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: What luck! The dendan is slain by your cry. You are a hero, and manage to gather some of its oil. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span> / Dendan Oil]</li>
</ul>
