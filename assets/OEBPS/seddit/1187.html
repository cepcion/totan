<p class="TaleDestiny">(1187) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You wish to hunt elephants, but you know it is not a job for a novice. You hire several locals as your guides. In the brush on your first day, your guides spot a huge one. You are chosen to make the first attack&mdash;a great honor. You pray that your spear might find its mark.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Nervous, you jab at the great beast, but you miss the mark. The elephant is enraged, and rampages. Your weak nerve has endangered your friends. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You stand firm and deliver your attack with force and accuracy. The others congratulate you on your courage and skill. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
