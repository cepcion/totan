<p class="TaleDestiny">(1238) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>In this land, the Sultan owns a huge forest preserve. He seeks your help to study two things: Some people have reported that a strange beast, the rhinoceros, is present in the forest; and some trees have been stripped bare of their bark.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You station yourself in the forest, and in time you catch sight of the rhino. Your report delights the Sultan, though the question of the bark goes unanswered. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You quickly find the rhino and spend a full day observing it. You notice that his skin seems to itch him quite abominably. Finally, you see the rhino rubbing against a tree, stripping its bark. The Sultan is enlightened and delighted by your report. [D+1 / S+2 / Scholarship / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
