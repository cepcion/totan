<p class="TaleDestiny">(1702) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Having heard legends of the regal elephant, you head into the savannah in search of one. After many days of wandering, you spot one near some tall grass. Not wanting to disturb the creature, you hide in the waving blades of grass to watch as it bathes. You are alarmed to see a band of natives approaching the beast with spears and arrows.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You leap up and let out a shout of warning. The magnificent elephant looks at you and finally notices the hunters. Bellowing, it charges, scattering the poachers. The noble animal looks at you with intelligent eyes that seem to thank you for your generosity. He kneels before you, allowing you to caress his forehead. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Knowing the value of ivory, you decide to join the hunters uninvited. Angry for your intrusion at first, the primitives are impressed by your bravery and your fancy steel weapons. They offer you the finest parts of the carcass and your choice of its magnificent tusks. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Weapon Use]</p>
