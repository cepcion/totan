<p class="TaleDestiny">(1782) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You find yourself in the mysterious Palace of 100 Closets. Your kind host has invited you to explore his home, and you are amazed at the wonders you encounter: But you find the hundredth door locked and cannot enter. You grow curious about what is hidden there, and you try to convince your host that no harm will come from allowing you just one little peek.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your host insists that some treasures are far too dangerous, and that they must be shielded from the eyes of all mortals. Despite offers, cajolery, and threats, your request is flatly denied. [S+1]</p>
