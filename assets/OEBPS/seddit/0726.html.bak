<p>As you kneel before the fire, a wreath of fire floating in mid-air appears before you. Strange voices echo in your ears, summoning you to the flames.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You close your eyes and concentrate on your prayers to throw off the fatal call. Soon the voices fade and, when you open your eyes, the flames are gone. You feel that you have passed a great test. [D+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED, INSANE, BEGUILING  (All mandatory)</span>: The voices speak to you in a voice that drips cunning, and promises you the fulfillment of all your dreams and ambitions, if only you will submit yourself in worship to the flames. You resist the siren call as long as you can, then suddenly succumb and leap into the fire. The voices turn to cruel mockery and laughter as you burn in great pain and are finally consumed.
