<p>You have decided to take a voyage. One evening you see the other wailing while tossing something over the side of the boat. You are concerned that the other is tossing items of the passengers&rsquo; overboard. You attack!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> The other cries out and says that he is tossing the remains of his crushed sculpture collection. A rival came and smashed it in his absence. Touched by the tale you cease your attack and offer the other some money to start his collection again.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: The other cries out and says that he is tossing the remains of his crushed sculpture collection. A rival came and smashed it in his absence. Looking at the bits of sculpture, you recognize some of it from your journeys. You tell the other of a spot where he can fish some up from where a ship sank not too long ago. The other thanks you profusely. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
