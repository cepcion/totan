<p class="TaleDestiny">(1438) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>As you approach, you see the other is deep in thought. He raises his hands, then drops them. &ldquo;If it is to be, it is to be. And what will not, will never be.&rdquo; You think that you can profit if you can manage to understand what the other is speaking of.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you struggle to think of something to say, the other departs. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You reply, &ldquo;What will be, is what The Most High wills, and is it not His will that all determine their own fates?&rdquo; Delighted by your perspicacity, the other showers you with gifts before moving on.
