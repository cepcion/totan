<p class="TaleDestiny">(1924) - WILDERNESS LORE, ENDURING HARDSHIP, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, you do what must be done. This sorrowful wretch will never learn except at the end of a sound beating.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The anguished cries of the other are more than you can bear. You leave the beating half-done to wallow in your own sorrows. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Nature teaches a hard lesson, and you must be willing to do the same. Despite the pleas from the other, you deliver the well-deserved beating with as much mercy as nature allows. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You just can&rsquo;t bring yourself to do it. You have no choice but to hire a hunchback to finish the beating for you. To your disgust, the hunchback enjoys the task, so you find that you need to teach him a lesson as well. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
