<p class="TaleDestiny">(2457) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>In the middle of some nameless village, you come across some villagers mercilessly beating a dark misshapen creature. Though their victim is a twisted parody of a human, your heart goes out to him, and you feel you must intervene.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Striking out with your cudgel, you scatter the timid villagers. To your amazement, when you turn to help the unfortunate creature, it has transformed into a shimmering being of light! &ldquo;You have aided me when none other would. May Allah guide your steps from this day forward!&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: After you chase away the villagers, you discover that you have rescued a mighty spirit! Knowing of their powers, you demand riches for your reward. &ldquo;A good deed well done should be its own reward!&rdquo; The spirit declares. Your greed is returned with justice as your gold is turned to dust. [D-1 / S+2 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
