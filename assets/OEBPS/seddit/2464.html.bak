<p class="TaleDestiny">(2464) - APPEARANCE  (M), MAGIC</p>
<p>You arrive at the palace of your distant kinsman. To your amazement, you find the halls abandoned: his servants have all fled. You finally find your relative sitting uneasily in his chamber, muttering about a curse of wings that assails his palace night after night. You resolve to lend your aid in whatever way you can. That night, you watch from a place of concealment. You discover the cause of your friend&rsquo;s misfortune as a cloud of black birds enters the palace and transforms into a woman.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> Before she can approach your cousin, you seize her. She gazes into your eyes, and you are lost at once. Succumbing to her charms, you satisfy her every request. In the morning she is gone, but so too it seems is the curse that hung over your cousin. [D+1 / Seduction / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You recognize that the ghost&mdash;for that what she is&mdash;is cursed to haunt this place. But with just a few words, you unravel the curse and free her; all that remains is a single black feather. [D+1 / S+2]</p>
