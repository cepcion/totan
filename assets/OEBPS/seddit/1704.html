<p class="TaleDestiny">(1704) - WEAPON USE, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You can hear the tumult before you even enter the village. A &ldquo;tamed&rdquo; elephant has gone berserk and is on a rampage.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Grabbing a firebrand, you set a wagon full of hay aflame. With the help of a couple of burly men, you push the cart of fire towards the elephant. Afraid of the burning cart, the elephant turns to flee out into the plain, posing no more threat to the villagers. [D+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Grabbing up a long spear, you charge after the panicked animal. But what use is a wooden stick against two tons of elephant? First your weapon, then you, are hurled through the air with casual ease by the mighty beast. [S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: With your princely bearing and commanding features, you rally the villagers to deal with the dangerous animal. With a combination of ropes and spears, you trap the creature and the grateful owner is able to calm it down. You are then generously rewarded. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
