<p class="TaleDestiny">(1354) - STEALTH AND STEALING, CRIPPLED (M), ACCURSED (M)</p>
<p>You collect many diamonds, but it was a long day, and you are tired on the way back.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stumble and tread on a serpent, which bites you. You draw on your last bit of energy to run to a healer, who manages to save your life, though at a price. Still, your diamonds will remain even when your leg has healed. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You stumble, but your cat-like reflexes prevent you from stepping on any poisonous snakes, and you escape the valley much wealthier. [D+2 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Fabulous) / Giant Diamond]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">CRIPPLED, ACCURSED  (All mandatory)</span>: Alas, you slip and fall, and are stung by a serpent before you can arise. Painfully, you gain your feet and stagger toward a healer&rsquo;s dwelling. A pair of townspeople who pass by refuse to help you under the impression you are drunk, and you expire on the doctor&rsquo;s doorstep. The doctor, dismayed, attempts to dispose of your body in secret, thus beginning an entire chain of unlikely but memorable events, which you are alas not alive to observe. What a story they would make! [Death]</p>
