<p class="TaleDestiny">(2370) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You launch into a prepared speech, thinking yourself more clever than a tree full of monkeys.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: But suddenly your voice is muffled&mdash;for your mouth has disappeared like a healed wound. &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; says the other, &ldquo;of whom you would seek to deceive.&rdquo; Your mouth returns, but you keep it closed and leave. [Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: Your story and your handsome face cannot fail to succeed, you think&mdash;but suddenly you find that you stink, and your whole body is covered with boils. &ldquo;Do not presume to trick a trickster,&rdquo; says the other with a laugh. [D+1 / Lose Appearance]</p>
