<p>You pass a slave auction. The other is a wealthy bidder. You wish nothing to do with the proceedings. As you pass the other calls out, &ldquo;There! That one! I&rsquo;ll take that one for the same price as the first.&rdquo; The slave-seller&rsquo;s men grab you and start to drag you toward the other&rsquo;s chain of slaves. Your protests that you are not a slave go unheeded by the other&rsquo;s men.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are able to create a distraction by inciting the crowd with your protests. In the commotion you dash away and flee the area. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You notice that your assailants are all plagued with a rash that has a hardly known cure. You offer to heal them if they let you go. They are amenable to this and after they see progress in their healing, they keep their word. [D+2 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You notice that your assailants are all ex-sailors from a region you once sailed. You make quick friends with the man and they let you sneak away while the other and the slave seller are distracted. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
