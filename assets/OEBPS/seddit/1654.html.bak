<p>The other approaches you late one night, lamenting his lost love. You have little patience for someone so blessed complaining about his failures in love. You strike him out of frustration.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Everyone around you is aghast at your temper. You know when the other recovers he&rsquo;ll want to get back at you. You run. [<span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other is taken aback momentarily, but then smiles. &ldquo;I see you have been in my predicament, and you&rsquo;re right, eventually I will find the one. Let me buy you a drink.&rdquo; [D+1]</p>
