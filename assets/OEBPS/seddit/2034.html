<p class="TaleDestiny">(2034) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>After many days of travel, you visit the local bathhouse, anxious for the peace and cleanliness it brings. The town is not a wealthy one, and the public baths are crude and ill-attended. So great is your need that you ignore the decor and dip into the warm waters. Luxuriating, you drift off to sleep. When you awaken, you find yourself alone. Calling out, no one appears. Worse, the attendants have taken your clothes and your belongings. You wander the halls for a while, but the stillness is absolute. The very last room is behind a locked door. Angered, you beat on it until it smashes open. You find a jeweled tile trapdoor in the floor. Mysterious glyphs cover the surface.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The door perplexes you and helps your situation not one iota. You are forced into the street to buy clothing. Your nakedness is shameful. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
