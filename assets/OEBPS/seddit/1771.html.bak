<p class="TaleDestiny">(1771) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You are lost in the great savannah; three days have passed since last you ate, and your vision is starting to fade. You spy in the distance what looks to be a tent, and you race towards it, hoping that those within can deliver you from your plight! But as you come close, you realize it is no tent but instead a huge lion, sleeping after a midday repast. Most of the carcass sits near, as even the vultures fear to come too close to the king of the beasts!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Driven to desperation by your hunger, you lunge forward to steal a morsel of meat. But the lion&rsquo;s instincts are too strong and he awakens at your approach! Forced to abandon your meal, it isn&rsquo;t long before lack of food steals your wits as well as your sense. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Silent as a shadow, you ease your way across the ground. Not even breathing, you reach out with a razor-sharp knife and cut a haunch of meat free, never taking your wary gaze from the sleeping lion. Your prize secure, you retreat as cautiously as you approached, with the king of beasts none the wiser. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
