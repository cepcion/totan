<p class="TaleDestiny">(2455) - None</p>
<p>Hunger gnaws at your belly, and you can see that the animals here suffer the same as you. Out of arrows, you are forced to follow a gangly antelope, hoping that it will collapse before you do.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die, adding two each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Enduring Hardship</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Determined</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">1&ndash;3: Your hunger overcomes you. You collapse into the dust. Sometime later, you wake, with no recollection of where you are or how you came to be there. [S+1 / Have another player move you to any land  space]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4+: Your endurance proves greater than your prey. Though the meat is tough, it is enough to keep you going until you reach the next town. [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</li>
