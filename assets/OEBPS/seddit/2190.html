<p class="TaleDestiny">(2190) - LUCK, WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Your horse covers many miles before it is forced to slow down when the storm intensifies.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize you must find shelter or risk harming the both of you. You see some overhanging rocks nearby and you know they will do nicely. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You spy a caravan and make for it. The merchant and his servants watch you nervously as you approach.</p>
<ul>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill" style="list-style-type:none;"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Not noticing their agitation, you ask for shelter from the storm. Relieved, they honor your request. [D+1 / S+1]</li>
<li style="list-style-type:none;"><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You ask for shelter from the storm. They eye your sword and ask if you would act as their guard until they reach their destination, for they have been plagued by bandits along the way. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</li>
