<p class="TaleDestiny">(1360) - QUICK THINKING, BEGUILING</p>
<p>You stride through the valley, slaying serpents as you go. You rescue an old man from a great serpent. You learn that he is the Sultan of this land, thrown here by his wicked Vizier, who now rules in his stead. You agree to help the Sultan regain his kingdom.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You confront the wicked Vizier outright, and his loyal guards chase you from the city. You vow to use greater caution and craft in your dealings in the future. [D+2 / S+2 / Beguiling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, BEGUILING</span>: You powder the Sultan&rsquo;s body and hide him in the Vizier&rsquo;s bedroom. The Vizier sees a &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; and dies of fright. The old Sultan is restored to power and you are named his heir. [D+3 / S+3 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
