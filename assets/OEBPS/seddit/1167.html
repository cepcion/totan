<p class="TaleDestiny">(1167) - MAGIC</p>
<p>No matter where you go, the old barber drives you mad with his incessant chatter. Finally you challenge him to a contest of magical spells&mdash;he must leave if he is the loser. At last you&rsquo;ll get peace!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, the old barber&rsquo;s boasts are not exaggerated&mdash;he is a master of magic. You are forced to continue listening to him, which brings sorrow under your eaves. [<span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You win the contest, but he is quite good. You change your mind and decide to keep him with you as a teacher. [D+2]</p>
