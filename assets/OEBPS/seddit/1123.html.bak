<p class="TaleDestiny">(1123) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You have come across a city long hidden from the rest of the world; the inhabitants are hostile to outsiders. They do not resemble your people, but the natives of the region do resemble the city dwellers.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Modeling yourself on one of the strange natives, you devise an effective disguise. Together, you enter the lost city and make many fascinating discoveries. [D+1 / S+2 / Scholarship]</p>
