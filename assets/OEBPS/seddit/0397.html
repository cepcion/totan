<p class="TaleDestiny">(397) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The other is in rather difficult straits at the moment, but agrees to try to aid you when you convince him that you can help him in return.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You make known your needs, and quickly find that there is little he can do. You leave him to his fate. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Your own memories of hardship lead you to question the other about his predicament. Your conversation brings you greater understanding and you decide to truly help the other, giving up your plans of trickery. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
