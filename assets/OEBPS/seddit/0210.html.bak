<p>You soon discover that the other is desperate for conversation. Since you seem cooperative, you are held captive and forced to listen to his inane babbling for nights on end.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You see little that you can do save suffer. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship/ <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You encourage the other to continue far into the night, pretending that you are fascinated with every word. Eventually, his chatter is so dull that he puts himself to sleep. You make your escape and help yourself to his purse as compensation for your suffering. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
