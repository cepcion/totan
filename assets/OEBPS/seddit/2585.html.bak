<p class="TaleDestiny">(2585) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You must send some money to your family as soon as possible or they will lose their home. You know of one in this town who has his fingers in a great many ventures; his associates in your hometown can get money to loved ones far faster than you can travel the distance yourself. All the other asks in return is that you enter the home of the other&rsquo;s greatest rival and steal a book of accounts from him. You agree to do so that very night.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are caught sneaking into the rival&rsquo;s home. The anger of the other at your failure is fearsome indeed. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The task is simplicity itself for one of your skill. Not only do you secure the book for the other, but when you creep back into his house, you spy him sitting on a wondrous carpet. The other speaks a special word and the rug lifts him into the air! The next night, after you have delivered the book, you return unseen and avail yourself of the carpet. [D+1 / Flying Carpet]</p>
