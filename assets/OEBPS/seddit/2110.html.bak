<p>The people living near the Magnetic Mountain have long suffered from its ill effects. You would aid them if you could, but you know that it is beyond your knowledge. You have heard of a certain magician, though, who may be able to help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You journey to the home of the reclusive magician, deep in the wilderness. He is impatient for you to leave, so he presses a jar of oil into your hands and sends you on your way. It is the oil of the Skordon plant. To your amazement, metal items coated in the oil are unaffected by the Mountain! [D+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: The eccentric magician refuses to see you when you arrive at his tower. Refusing to be rejected, you stand at his gate and lavish praise upon him as though he were the Caliph himself! Amused by your flattery, he descends from his tower and hands you a magnificent artifact, then sends you on your way. [D+1 / Treasure]</p>
