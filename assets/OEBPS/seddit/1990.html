<p class="TaleDestiny">(1990) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>At the last village before you reach the Valley of Dogs, you have a chance to speak with a kindly old innkeeper. He warns you about the dangers of the Valley.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though he is too old to guide you himself, the innkeeper does know of a secret path that should get you across safely. You are happy to give him a small gift in exchange for the information. [D+1 / W-1
