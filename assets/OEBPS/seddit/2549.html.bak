<p class="TaleDestiny">(2549) - WEAPON USE, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You take advantage of a cool, clear night to cross the otherwise inhospitable desert. Up ahead, you see the light of a campfire and the raucous sounds of men drinking. Sneaking closer, you see five bandits laughing and drinking and tormenting a thin youth. Although the youth wears threadbare clothes and is coated in dirt, you recognize the child of a local sheik. You decide you cannot leave this wretch to such a fate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait until the men are out of earshot of the men, then make your presence known to the youth. Surprised, the youth yelps. The bandits investigate and you flee. They catch and thrash you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Drawing your weapon, you charge the drunken men and scatter them. You seize the youth and run off into the night. When you pause, the young one explains, &ldquo;I am sorry, sir, but I must return. I have been chosen by Allah to help these criminals to see the error of their ways.&rdquo; With that, the child walks back toward the camp. [S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You slip into the camp undetected and slide your hand over the young one&rsquo;s mouth. Lifting the tormented form from the ground, you dash off into the night. You escape with angry shouts and vows to chase you to the ends of the earth echoing in your ears. Grateful for your actions, the one you have rescued teaches you the art of disguise. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
