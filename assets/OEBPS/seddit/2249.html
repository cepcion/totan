<p class="TaleDestiny">(2249) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Your better nature moves you to wish to be of use to the other as he relentlessly spews his dark words. When the local guard comes to shoo the other away, you accompany him to be sure he is safe for the night. The other lives in a mean hut on the outskirts of the city in the foulest of conditions.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The night passes roughly, with no sleep for you. As you leave the other the next day, you find yourself feeling less and less healthy.
