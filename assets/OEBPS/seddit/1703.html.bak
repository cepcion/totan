<p class="TaleDestiny">(1703) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>After hiding in your shelter from three days of terrible rains, you are delighted to see the sun again. After saying a short prayer of thanks to the Lord of All Sunrises, you pack up your belongings and continue your journey. Just a few miles away, however, you discover a young elephant trapped in a deep mud hole, struggling to escape.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You quickly realize that if you wait long enough, the unfortunate creature will succumb and you can harvest its tusks for their ivory without danger. You sit down to wait, and doze off. A loud trumpeting wakes you later: the elephant&rsquo;s mother has come to rescue it! Hastily you flee from the angry beast. Thus Allah rewards the selfish, you realize! [D-1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: &ldquo;All of Allah&rsquo;s creatures are deserving of mercy,&rdquo; you say to yourself and seek some method to aid the elephant. Nearby you find a dead tree that looks sturdy. Taking out your axe, you cut enough of the tree to drop the trunk towards the mud hole. With the tree to aid him, the small elephant pulls free from the mire, salutes you, and makes to rejoin his herd. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
