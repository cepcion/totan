<p class="TaleDestiny">(782) - LUCK, QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>The odd, man-shaped beast seems to be in pain and cannot walk. You offer it aid, and it crawls onto your shoulders. Once there, it refuses to let go!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It rides you like a horse and mistreats you terribly. You must go where it bids you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, QUICK THINKING</span>: After many days of this cruel treatment, you do not despair but instead seek comfort from your woes in wine. Upon witnessing this, the beast demands a drink. It gulps great quantities and is soon besotted. Happily, it falls from your shoulders in a stupor, and you make your escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: When it slumbers, you produce the Golden Bridle, and when it awakens, it is forced to do as you command. You are tempted to ride upon its shoulders to teach it the folly of ways, but you show it mercy. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
