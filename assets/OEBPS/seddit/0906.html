<p class="TaleDestiny">(906) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>As you come to a clearing amidst a grove of trees, you see a small ape&mdash;singing a song! Such a strange beast could make you famous, but with no one around to help you, you are left to your own devices, so you step forward to introduce yourself.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Without a word, the ape disappears into the trees. You shake yourself, wondering if your senses have deceived you. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: The song is one well-known to you from ancient works, and you start singing additional verses from memory and improvisation. When you finish your own song, the ape reveals himself to be an &rsquo;efreet visiting among mortals. He is most delighted for your company. He offers to join you as you go on your way, for it has been many a year since he last walked the world of men. [D+2 / S+2 / Hairless Ape]</p>
