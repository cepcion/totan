<p class="TaleDestiny">(1338) - COURTLY GRACES, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You stride to the gate. Though a force bars your way, you shout, &ldquo;Open in the name of Allah!&rdquo; The barrier is removed. You walk in, and lo! The streets are bustling with people! You request an audience with the Sultan.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are unable to obtain an audience, and are ignored as a raving madman. The people of the fortress throw you out, and when you look back, you see no signs of habitation. Let this serve as a lesson in manners. [D+2 / S+2 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, STORYTELLING</span>: The Sultan seems oblivious to the devastation outside, so you tell him what has occurred in the passing centuries. He weeps at his own arrogance, thanks you for your wisdom, and gives you gifts. [D+3 / S+3 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Wisdom / Treasure]</p>
