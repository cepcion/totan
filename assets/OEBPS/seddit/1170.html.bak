<p>You have listened to the old man go on and on about this and that and he hasn&rsquo;t even started cutting your hair. Finally your patience runs out and you let loose a blistering oath fit to singe the ears of a dockworker.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The old man properly chastises you, then resumes his rambling without missing a beat. You flee, screaming, and your hair never gets cut. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: &ldquo;By the beard of Al-Musif, let me alone!&rdquo; you cry. Taken aback, the Barber quotes Al-Musif by heart, intoning passages you have never heard.
