<p>As you wander through a wilderness, you hear a faint cry for help. Coming nearer, you see a large black pavilion. Within is a horrible giant, and five men in a large cage; the giant has spitted a sixth man and is cooking him over a fire. You attempt to sneak past, but the giant hears you. Maddened at the prospect of joining the others in the food pit, you slash out with your sword, but it is as if you are trying to fell a cypress with a feather. When your turn comes, the giant nibbles you, grunts scornfully, and tosses you in the garbage heap. You see a sparkling object in the midden which you take before fleeing.
