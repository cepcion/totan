<p class="TaleDestiny">(1875) - WILDERNESS LORE, SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You are desperate for assistance with some manual labor, but you can find no aid save for this other. Reluctantly, you agree to pay him some coins for his efforts.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With only a small amount of correction, the other proves adequate for your needs. Praise Allah, you should learn to be less judging of others! [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You discover that controlling the other is really no different from handling most beasts of burden. You find the other eager to please, and with his aid the profit from your ventures is greater than you expected. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: After observing the other for a few hours, you realize that you have seen this kind of madness before. Sailors too long at sea have shown similar derangements. Armed with this knowledge, you are able to treat his madness. In his gratitude, he offers to join you on your quest. [D+1 / S+1 / You may lose one status of your choice]</p>
