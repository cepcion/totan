<p class="TaleDestiny">(401) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>Your victim, not wishing to believe ill of you, falls for your lie that there is a jinni enslaved in this very magic lamp (an old brass thing you found somewhere) and is willing to pay you handsomely for it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Afterwards, you accidentally meet him again, and he swears vengeance upon you for the trick you have played. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You further convince him that it would be very dangerous to release the jinni, but that the mere possession of the lamp will confer upon him great fortune. Your trick is so well thought out that the other cheerfully pays the price and never suspects that the lamp is worthless.
