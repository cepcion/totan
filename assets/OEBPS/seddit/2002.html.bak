<p>As you rest from the rigors of travel, a richly dressed prince and his entourage pass by. Noting the dust on your clothes, he knows you to be a traveler: He draws a weathered map from an ivory tube, explaining that he recently purchased this from an honest-seeming barker, but now he wonders if he was duped. He wishes to know if you can authenticate the map. You ask him a handful of questions about its provenance and then study it for several minutes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Convinced that it is a fake, you lamely attempt to point out deficiencies in the map, but are unable to make your case. The prince and his cohort soon quit themselves of you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: At least a portion of the map relates to areas you have visited. Other sections cannot be true given what you know about the natural world. Your explanation of the flaws is reasoned and complete, yet you convey your doubts with suitable discretion to avoid embarrassment on the part of the prince. He rewards you with a bauble he has been carrying&mdash;and the map itself, which holds some worthwhile information. [D+2 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore / Treasure]</p>
