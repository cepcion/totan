<p class="TaleDestiny">(262) - LUCK</p>
<p>The other is crazed and obviously obsessed with you. You find the other pitiful in ways, and repulsive in others. The other has tried a disguise to trick you. Thinking the other might have evil intentions, you try to avoid him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He sees you and jumps up in rage. &ldquo;Ah-ha!&rdquo; he shouts. &ldquo;You are the one I have sought for many miles, through hardship and injustice. Prepare to yield your life for your crimes!&rdquo; You take advantage of the other&rsquo;s long tirade to flee and disappear into the crowd. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: He sees you and catches up to you. In his fury, the other attacks hastily and stumbles at your feet. When he is at your mercy, you take this opportunity to rid yourself of his threats. At the same time, you hate to leave his purse unattended. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
