<p class="TaleDestiny">(1770) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A dear friend of yours has been captured by a town of blood-thirsty infidels! Whilst sitting by the fire, trying to imagine a plan to rescue him, you become aware of a feeling of being watched. You spin and draw your sword, facing the intruder. To your surprise it is a great tangle-maned lion, staring down at you from a large rock. To your astonishment, the lion speaks, in tones regal and powerful: &ldquo;Put your blade away, traveler: We have no conflict this night. We may be of aid to each other, though. Those who have taken your friend also hunt my kind. Together we both may be rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The lion tells you of another tribe of natives, foes of the infidels who have sought their hidden village for many months. Armed with this information, you approach the friendly tribe and convince them to attack their enemies now. Their war party arrives at the savage village just in time to save your friend from the cookpot! [D+1 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The lion instructs you to wrap about yourself one of the gazelle hides you have collected. Gently, the noble beast lifts your limp form in his jaws. Thus disguised, you attract no attention as the lion carries you near the infidels&rsquo; camp. Thus you are able to catch them completely by surprise, and leaping into their midst with weapon drawn, you kill two of them before the rest flee into the night. [D+1 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
