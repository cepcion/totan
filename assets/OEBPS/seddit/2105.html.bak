<p class="TaleDestiny">(2105) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>As you follow the twisting mountain path, you are suddenly grasped by a giant invisible hand and smashed against a nearby cliff face. Once your head clears, you find yourself pinned to the wall by an invisible force. Looking around, you see a magician holding a bejeweled scepter. &ldquo;With this, I alone can control the forces of the Magnetic Mountain!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In exchange for your freedom, you agree to show the mad magician where you have secreted all of your wealth. True to his word, he waves the scepter and you are released from your bondage. You show him your hidden cache, and, cackling, he takes your money and vanishes in a puff of smoke. [S+1 / W-3 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: &ldquo;Surely you think me a fool!&rdquo; You retort to the magician. &ldquo;Everyone knows that no one can control the Magnetic Mountain.&rdquo; He proves his claim by stopping the flow of magnetism from the mountain. In the very instant you are released, you attack him. In the struggle, the scepter falls from his grasp, vanishing into a nearby chasm. The magician dives after it, and you see neither ever again.
