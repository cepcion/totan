<p class="TaleDestiny">(1269) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>A man asks your aid in his pearl-diving endeavors. He offers you a small percentage of the take to sit in his boat and hold the rope.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You agree. Presently some soldiers row up, and claim you have stolen the boat from the Sultan. &ldquo;I am just holding this rope for a man,&rdquo; you claim, but when you draw up the rope, no one is there. The guards waste no time in dispensing justice. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: After a few moments, you tie the rope to the boat and slip into the water&mdash;he is swimming away with all the pearls! You clout him on the head with some coral and take your share of the loot. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
