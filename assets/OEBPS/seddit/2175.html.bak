<p>As you continue you to cry out in defiance of nature, a bolt of lightning strikes no more than ten feet in front of you. In its wake stands a man with a spear drawn. He bellows to you, &ldquo;Prove your worth!&rdquo; and moves quickly to attack you.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Weapon Use</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Quick Thinking</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;6: You crumple to the ground as he slices into your leg in a flash, then disappears. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">7+: As though the other were as slow as a turtle, you sidestep the attack and disarm your foe in a single fluid motion, holding the spear at his back. He says, &ldquo;Your skills have won you this day.&rdquo; With that, he disappears, leaving the spear in your hands. [D+2 / S+2 / Sparkling Spear]</li>
