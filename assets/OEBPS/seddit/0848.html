<p class="TaleDestiny">(848) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>In trading with the other you obtain an item you believe to be of great value. It seems quite a bargain and promises to yield a great profit when sold.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Alas, when you present the item to a merchant to sell it, you discover it is a worthless fake. The merchant is kind to you, though, and teaches you to avoid such mistakes in the future. [D-1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Careful scrutiny indicates the item&rsquo;s true worth, and you avoid an unwise purchase. You profit greatly from trading with him. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
