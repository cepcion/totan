<p class="TaleDestiny">(2532) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Traveling one night, you hear the distant sounds of someone screaming. As you rush to investigate, you crest a dune and see four men surrounding a young woman. You draw your sword and shout, hoping to scare them off. Instead they turn and grin at you, the woman included. It was a trap! From all around come more bandits. They take you to their leader, whom you immediately recognize as a successful merchant from a nearby city. Thinking on your feet, you play to his famous ego, telling him how impressed you are to meet him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He laughs at you and quickly relieves you of your belongings. However, he does decide that you may join his band for awhile&mdash;to prove how much you worship him. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: He takes a liking to you. He tells you that the drab life of a merchant has paled, and he has decided to add spice to his life with nefarious deeds. You encourage him, saying that with his skills and acumen, he could become a legendary bandit. He decides that perhaps you may serve his reputation more as a tale-weaver than a victim, and he hires you to tell his stories far and wide. He warns you that unless he is properly famous, he will consider the bargain forfeit. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
