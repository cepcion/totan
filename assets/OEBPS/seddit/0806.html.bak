<p class="TaleDestiny">(806) - BEAST FORM  (M),  APPEARANCE</p>
<p>As you humble yourself before him, he gazes closely upon your features and cries, &ldquo;Aha! Aren&rsquo;t you the dog I have sworn to kill?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;This act of obeisance is meant to deceive me!&rdquo; He wounds you severely before he discovers his mistake, and he flees into the night.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">BEAST FORM  (mandatory),  APPEARANCE</span>: As he raises his sword, he gets a much better look at you. Your distinctive form could not long be mistaken for another. Realizing his mistake, the other apologizes profusely, and tells you the story of his vengeance&mdash;it is quite an interesting tale, and you promise to tell it to others that they might avoid the mistakes he has made.
