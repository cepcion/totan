<p>As soon as you enter the quiet glade, you feel your breath taken away. The beauty that surrounds you is truly a testament to the glory of the All-Merciful! Clouds of colored butterflies surround you. You wish you could share this beauty with others.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try most carefully to capture a precious few, but alas the delicate creatures either avoid you or do not survive your clumsy efforts. Though you cannot share the experience, your soul feels warmed from this opportunity to see such wonder first-hand. [S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Realizing that great care will be required, you contrive to bait the creatures into a large jar you are carrying. Placing flowers within, you coax many inside and seal it loosely. When you present the wondrous creatures to the emir, he is impressed by your care and generosity, and he praises you for all to hear. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
