<p class="TaleDestiny">(2209) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you pass through dense woods, you discover that all around you are the remains of a vast, ruined city, deserted long ago. Now, nowhere do you find two stones that still stand atop each other, until in a small clearing you find a stone obelisk, graven with strange symbols.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot read the symbols, and depart unsatisfied. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The language is ancient but not unknown to one who has studied as long as you. You learn what you can, and when you come to the nearest town, you make sure that word of your discovery is made known to the prince of this region.
