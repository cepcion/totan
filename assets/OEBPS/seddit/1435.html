<p class="TaleDestiny">(1435) - LUCK</p>
<p>Your attack has only one effect: it draws the full attention of the other, and also his wrath. At his gesture, a powerful force grabs you and hurls you down a well.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You struggle for many days to escape, and eventually a passer-by hears your cries and lowers to you a rope that you might climb out. You have suffered greatly in your captivity, though, and your heart is heavy, though you count yourself fortunate that you did not fare worse.
[D+1 / S+1 / Lose Appearance / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: A scorpion falls on your head. You quickly kill it, then wonder whence it came. Your search reveals a small crevice leading to a forgotten treasure room. What an astounding stroke of luck! You loot the place and escape through a hidden trap-door. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
