<p class="TaleDestiny">(1650) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>A magician of great power lives in a vine-encrusted cavern. Though most avoid the place lest they risk the other&rsquo;s wrath, you dare the attempt, for the assistance of such a one would be a great aid to you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you make your way through the cavern entrance, the vines surrounding the opening come alive, grabbing you tightly around the neck until consciousness flees you. When you awaken, the landscape has changed dramatically: apparently you were brought to another land. You are glad to be alive. [S+1 / Have another player move you two spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The vines around the cavern entrance seem familiar to you: you recognize their ability to grab unsuspecting victims. Luckily you also realize that by moving silently you can pass by them unmolested. Your entrance impresses the magician dwelling within. He doesn&rsquo;t join you, but he bestows upon you an amazing gift. [D+2 / S+2 / Treasure]</p>
