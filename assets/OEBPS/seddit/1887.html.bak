<p class="TaleDestiny">(1887) - STEALTH AND STEALING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>The wretched scoundrel deserves no mercy, whatever his condition may be! You ruthlessly batter the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: In light of his poor health, perhaps you should have been more cautious. You accidentally slay the other and are overcome with remorse. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: While the other crawls towards safety, you notice he dropped his purse. Considering he is near-death, you are certain he won&rsquo;t need it. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: The other&rsquo;s child comes running out to aid his aged parent, begging you to be merciful. The beauty of the young one entrances you. Your demeanor changes from angry shouts to honeyed words in an instant. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</p>
