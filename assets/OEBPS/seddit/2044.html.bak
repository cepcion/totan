<p class="TaleDestiny">(2044) - COURTLY GRACES, MAGIC</p>
<p>As a result of your daring, and the evidence you uncover, a wicked Vizier is revealed and beheaded. The Sultan grants you a choice of one item from the Vizier&rsquo;s possessions. When you arrive at the Vizier&rsquo;s palace, an old slave thanks you profusely for delivering the household from bondage to the evil man. As he washes your feet, he whispers that among the treasures to be found in this place, the greatest is a portal to an enchanted kingdom. You question him further and he shows you a beaten brass lamp. It appears worthless compared to the gold and jewels that fill the palace.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can take the lamp or something that appears much more valuable:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you take something else</span>: The treasure you choose is indeed worth much, but it carries a taint from the wicked Vizier. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you take the lamp</span>: Taking the old slave at his word, you accept the lamp. He shows you the gestures necessary to open the door to the kingdom, but warns that those who inhabit that place are cultured. They expect the same from their guests.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleChoice">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wander the kingdom and see many wondrous sights. Your interactions with the residents, however, are lacking. To teach you better manners, they set a task before you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</li>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: The kingdom is all the old slave described. The buildings are glorious, the streets are paved in gold, and the denizens are fascinating. Your grace and manners please them, and they reward you with enchanted good fortune. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You study the lamp for a time and learn a great deal about the enchantments placed on it. Fearful that your manners will displease the residents, however, you barter the item to the new Vizier. This brings you great favor with him. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
