<p class="TaleDestiny">(2283) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other is planning to transfer many fine vases from one of his villas to another. You think that it would be a grand punishment to destroy his finery.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You arrange for a livestock stampede as the other&rsquo;s wagons pass a farm. The horses are spooked and the cart is overturned in the ruckus, destroying the vases. You can&rsquo;t help gloating. Unfortunately, your information was wrong: the other was giving the vases to the Sultan as a gift. The Sultan punishes you soundly for your vandalism.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You plan to meet the other&rsquo;s cart in the woods and have hired thugs overturn the shipment. On consideration, you make another twist in your plan and instead threaten the other with the action unless he gifts the vases to the Sultan in both your names. He relents and the Sultan is most pleased with the gesture.
