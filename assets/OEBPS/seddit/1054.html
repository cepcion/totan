<p class="TaleDestiny">(1054) - SEAMANSHIP, SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The captain is wringing his hands and looks very nervous. You ask him what is wrong.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He replies that he misses his family and worries about them. However, when you wake in the morning and find the captain and crew gone, you suspect that he wasn&rsquo;t completely frank with you. The ship drifts aimlessly to an unknown shore. [D+1 / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: He trusts your judgment and reveals that the ship is irrevocably lost. However, you read the charts and the heavens to discover where you are. The voyage resumes normally, and the captain is very grateful. [D+1 / Seamanship]</p>
