<p class="TaleDestiny">(1767) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Fleeing from a hungry band of angry villagers, you see possible shelter in a pile of gray rocks towering over the grasslands. Perhaps you would have chosen a different path if you had known it was the den of a lion&rsquo;s pride!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The cannibals give up the chase as soon as they see you approach the lion den, and with good reason! The lions do not take kindly to your intrusion. You are fortunate that Allah decided that a thunderstorm should drive the lions to seek cover before they finish you off. [S+2 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: Though the cannibals thought you looked tasty, the lions seem to be impressed by your princely looks and bearing. They keep to a respectful distance during all the hours you remain in their den, waiting for your pursuers to move on. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
