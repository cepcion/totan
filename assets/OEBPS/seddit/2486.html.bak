<p class="TaleDestiny">(2486) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you sit under a palm passing a hot day, you are joined by another, who begins a sad tale of loss. Spouse, children, parents, friends, relations&mdash;all have perished or, for one reason or another, have departed. At first, you are sympathetic, but in time, the other&rsquo;s litany becomes tiresome. It seems the other does nothing about what fate has decreed except complain. You lean over and strike the other&mdash;perhaps that will inspire action!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Taken aback, the other recoils. &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo; With nothing more to say, you shake your head and walk away. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The other leaps up, dagger at the ready. You speak harshly: &ldquo;Sit down, shut up, and listen!&rdquo; The force of your action and words compels the other. You explain that companionship, while always desired, is unnecessary for a seeker of knowledge. Reading, research, drafting&mdash;these are all worthy endeavors that are best completed alone with no distractions. As you talk, the other&rsquo;s eyes brighten as new possibilities come to light. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
