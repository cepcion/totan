<p class="TaleDestiny">(2134) - LUCK</p>
<p>Traveling at night to avoid a gang of bandits active in the area, you spy a silver glow on the horizon. Moving closer, you find a mystical ruined city bathed in a moonlight that appears to emanate from runes carved in stones. At first you seek treasures, but when none can be found, you decide to bring one of the glowing symbols back to civilization.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Every rune you can reach is embedded in a massive stone. You are unable to find any you can take. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Although most every symbol you see is part of a building or etched on immense stones, you luck into a smallish boulder that has been inscribed. Chiseling it from the surrounding dirt, you heft it onto your back. Upon your arrival at the next city, sages and scholars flock to your side to study your discovery. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
