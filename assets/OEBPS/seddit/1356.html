<p class="TaleDestiny">(1356) - APPEARANCE, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You avoid all the snakes and collect many diamonds. However, you forget the way back and are forced to wait for a carcass to fall. One lands right at your feet; you grab on and are carried up.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The diamond hunters grow surly and demand rent on their transportation, or they will throw you back in the valley.
