<p class="TaleDestiny">(1247) - FATED  (M), STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>In a narrow ravine is a spring. Subtle clues lead you to believe that this is the spring spoken of in tales, which can change a man&rsquo;s form to that of a woman. You have no wish drink from it, but you do wish to collect a sample of the water for magical use. You make your way carefully down the ravine.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, FATED  (mandatory):</span> Suddenly you slip and fall directly into the spring. Alas, your deductions were correct&hellip; [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sex-Changed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You avoid falling in the water and collect a bottle for future use. [D+1]</p>
