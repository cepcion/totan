<p class="TaleDestiny">(1109) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>A beggar tells you a tale of a nearby cave filled with marvels. Investigating, you find the cave where you were told. Deep inside is a jet black pool and at its center is a small island. On the island are two chests of gold.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cautiously probe the pool. Suddenly, a skeletal hand explodes from the inky waters and draws you down! Terrified, you struggle, barely managing to escape. You run screaming from the cave.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: A guardian must lurk in the pool&mdash;so you rig ropes from the cave roof and swing to the island and back without touching the water. The chests are filled with gold and silver, and one also holds a most remarkable lance. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich / Sparkling Spear]</p>
