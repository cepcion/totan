<p class="TaleDestiny">(1725) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Boldly, you approach the Crystal Palace, determined to free the children imprisoned within. You ignore the sneers of the guards as long as you can; they are almost amused when they beat you and cast you into the dungeon.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After languishing in the dungeon for a few days, you hear a sound behind one of the walls. Suddenly, one of the stones falls to the floor with a crash, revealing a tunnel! Within the tunnel you discover an old man, who had been trying to dig his way out. &ldquo;Alas! I have dug in the wrong direction!&rdquo; he moans in despair: He is quickly cheered, however, when he realizes that he will have company to while away the boring dungeon hours. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You struggle with the guards as you are dragged to your cell. Skillfully distracting one of the guards, you steal his keys while he&rsquo;s worried about you kicking him in the face. [D+1 / One Hundred Keys]</p>
