<p class="TaleDestiny">(1848) - PIETY</p>
<p>You are awakened from a sound sleep by the Sultan&rsquo;s guards, who bind your hands and drag you through the city to an expansive cell with dozens of other sleepy and distraught strangers, who all have no notion why they have been taken. After a time, a guard arrives to announce that the Sultan&rsquo;s son has been murdered, and the Vizier has denounced all outsiders as traitorous dogs. Each person will be tortured in turn to reveal the guilty party. Several wretches fall to the ground in horror; others rail against the injustice. You kneel and raise your arms to the heavens: &ldquo;Allah, Who is all wise and compassionate to the true believers, take notice of our plight and deliver us from this wicked Vizier&rsquo;s grasp.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your pleas have no more effect than the raging, the begging, or the sobbing of the others. You are taken in turn and the coals are applied to your limbs. The pain is terrible and unhinges your mind. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Your passion and grace are overwhelming. The others join your cry as they kneel down besides you. The guards are disturbed, and cease removing prisoners to the torture chambers. In time, the Vizier arrives, screaming at the guards for their dereliction of duty. His face is red and his manner nearly incoherent. When he sees you at the center of the blessed throng, his mind snaps. &ldquo;Kill them, kill them all!&rdquo; he shrieks. Suddenly, he collapses, life drained from his body. Taking this as Allah&rsquo;s work, the guards release the prisoners. [D+2 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
