<p class="TaleDestiny">(1769) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You have been following a particularly healthy-looking deer deeper and deeper into the woods for many days. You break through the underbrush into a large clearing. You are amazed to discover that most of the clearing is dominated by an enormous marble pile, now tumbled and decayed with age. However, it is not so old that you cannot make out the forms of great stone lions decorating nearly every surface.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Boldly, you climb the steps into the dark and mysterious ruin. Within the shadowed depths, you discover a massive gem, mounted in an alabaster pedestal. A pack of real lions languishes within, but makes no move to obstruct your passage. Grinning with anticipation, you take hold of the enormous gemstone. A shock runs through you and your teeth clatter as you are knocked backwards twenty feet. You should have known that such an easy find would be cursed! [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You know that such places rarely offer rewards equal to the risks. You decide to accept the warning signs and continue searching for your quarry. [D+1]</p>
