<p class="TaleDestiny">(1373) - MAGIC, ACCURSED (M), ENSORCELLED (M), INSANE (M)</p>
<p>As you crest the hill, startled &rsquo;efreeti stare up at you; there are hundreds of them in some sort of council. You shout, &ldquo;Who here is leader?&rdquo; An enormous &rsquo;efreet rises; you challenge him to a duel of magics.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Of course, he blasts you right out of the Dusky Land. But you learned much from the duel, and will teach harsh lessons to any &rsquo;efreet who crosses you in the future. [D+2 / S+2 / Magic]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You battle for three days, and at the end you cover him with fire while crying the name of Allah. He shrieks and disappears forever. The other &rsquo;efreets bow to you and establish you as their suzerain. [D+4 /
S+3 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span> / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED, ENSORCELLED, INSANE  (All mandatory)</span>: The &rsquo;efreet lashes out at you with a spell to destroy your mind and leave you a witless idiot. Your affliction weakens your concentration, and he devours your mind like an almond cake. You spend your remaining days as a plaything for &rsquo;efreet children, who are as cruel as human children but infinitely more dangerous. Mercifully, you are not a very sturdy toy, and when you wear out, your broken and battered (and  barely recognizable) body is dropped back the world of humans, never more to function. [Death]</p>
