<p class="TaleDestiny">(2023) - PIETY</p>
<p>A crippled old man struggles with his burden. You pause to shoulder a large sack, easing his load. &ldquo;The Almighty One inspires me to aid you, my friend,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;Let us walk to the mosque and pray to He Above All in gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Offended by your interference, the old man shrieks that he is being robbed. A crowd gathers and harsh words are spoken. You panic and rush to escape. The old man and others provide the town guard with your description. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: The ancient one is pleased by your manner and actions. &ldquo;As Allah wishes, the mosque is indeed my destination,&rdquo; he confirms. When you arrive, he gifts you with a sack of coins. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
