<p class="TaleDestiny">(2547) - MAGIC</p>
<p>Traveling through a small, poor village, you hear children moaning and crying. In a rundown shack you discover a mother whose three children are dying of some unknown disease. You seek out the local seller of herbs and medicines, who is as poor as the other villagers. He informs you that the mother is an adulteress and it would not be proper to assist one such as her. You beg Allah for forgiveness, knock the old man unconscious, and carry him and his wares to the hut. There, you explain that you insist he care for the children.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Angered, he begins to work, applying salves and boiling teas. You wait here a few days to see if the cures work, and they do! The healer comes to you later and apologizes for his selfish behavior. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Watching him, you realize the old man aids his herbal remedies with magic. You quietly whisper, &ldquo;If your magic harms these children, my judgment will be swift.&rdquo; The other sighs and continues to work, but his gestures change slightly. Soon the children are bright and alert! The merchant curses you, &ldquo;I hope you live a thousand months, and not one brings you even a faint joy!&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
