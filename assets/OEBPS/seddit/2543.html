<p class="TaleDestiny">(2543) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The Sultan&rsquo;s court is full of many wondrous things&mdash;foods from all corners of the known world and experiences that would impress even the most jaded of adventurers. None of this, however, compares to the emerald-eyed beauty you saw dancing among a band of holy dervishes visiting the court. Over the next days, you could not get this one out of your mind.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You ask around every temple and mosque in the area, but to; no avail. No one seems to know of this wondrous creature who danced among the ascetics. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Realizing that no one would tell you where to find the object of your affection if you were to ask directly, you masquerade as a member of the order and join their rituals. Soon you find the one you seek and you profess your love. The other is moved and teaches you to achieve ecstasy in movement. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
