<p class="TaleDestiny">(470) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>To your amazement, you see the beggarly one enter the palace of the Prince of the Faithful. You hurry to inform the guards, who bring you before the Sultan himself. Immediately you recognize him as the beggar you followed! &ldquo;It is my sport,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;to travel among the people as a beggar&mdash;but you alone have penetrated the disguise. In return for your silence I offer you my hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You apologize for your curiosity, and enjoy a night of revel at the Sultan&rsquo;s expense. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You spend an evening in pleasant discourse with him, and he is moved by your sagacity. &ldquo;Never have I come across one so wise! I would have you near me as my trusted advisor.&rdquo; [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
