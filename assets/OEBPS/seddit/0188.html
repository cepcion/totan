<p class="TaleDestiny">(188) - STORYTELLING, ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>At your words, the other deeply sighs.&rdquo; I thank you for your kind words. Ah, if things were but different.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: So saying, the other bids you farewell and departs. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You stay to converse longer with the other and discuss with him his plight. Your fresh evaluation of the other&rsquo;s situation makes clear an obvious solution and a happy conclusion. The other is most pleased by your actions and praises you before the Maker of All Things. [D+1 / S+1 / Choice of <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if appropriate) or <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Because of what you have suffered in the past, you greatly desire to bring the other out of his plight. Your dogged determination to relieve the suffering of the other brings a happy conclusion, and a small sum is your reward. However, he is unhappy with some of the things you must do along the way. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max Poor)]
