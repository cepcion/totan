<p>By providence, you stumble upon the lair of a merman bandit who has been causing much trouble in this area, far from the sea. He is asleep&mdash;it would be a simple matter to steal his ill-gained goods, then perhaps lead the guards here to collect a bounty.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You decide that you have done enough to help and head on your way. Your venture is modestly profitable. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: However, the still, clear voice of your faith stops you. Instead of robbing him, you awaken him and question him about his actions. Soon you learn that it is the land  people who have victimized him! All that you see in his cave are his own goods, stolen back from the people who took advantage of a stranger. You ask to escort him back to the sea, many miles away. When you arrive at a distant harbor city, he sheds his disguise and underneath you see he is dressed in princely robes! &ldquo;You had every opportunity to turn on me,&rdquo; he says with a smile, &ldquo;But you chose not to. There is a place in my court for one such as you.&rdquo; [D+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
