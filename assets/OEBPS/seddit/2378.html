<p class="TaleDestiny">(2378) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>A friend of yours cites a tale of treachery and thievery: while he was pearl diving, a merman attacked him and stole the pearls he had gathered. You immediately draw your sword, vowing to find this merman and take back what was stolen.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You search the shore for a long time but the merman never appears. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You perch atop some rocks, staring out into the water for hours, and are finally rewarded with the appearance of the merman. The merman leaves a sack on the sand then dives back into the water. You seize the sack and retreat to your perch. Within are more pearls, gems and jewels than ever your friend could have gathered&mdash;taking this sack will be payment in full for the merman&rsquo;s crime. [S+1 / W+2
