<p class="TaleDestiny">(2127) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>A group of ruffians are ruthlessly beating an old man and laughing while they do so. You think to ask them why.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The leader, standing away from the pack, looks approachable, and you direct your question to him. The leader answers by drawing his sword. You wisely move away. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You fear that if you question the actions of the ruffians, it will be too late for the old man, so you draw your sword and attack. The ruffians are startled by your bravado and run away. The old man thanks you profusely for saving his life and gives you a gift. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
