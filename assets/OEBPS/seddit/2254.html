<p class="TaleDestiny">(2254) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You recognize the other as a member of a well-to-do merchant family from a town not many days&rsquo; travel away. You send a message to the family to gauge their interest in the wayward other. The family replies with an urgent plea for a safe return, and you see coins at the end of this venture. However, when you approach the other, you find him to be vehemently opposed to returning home. You decide to take matters into your own hands.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other resists you wildly, breaking away from you and escaping into a passing crowd, never to be seen in the area again. When you inform the family, they are disappointed but still grateful just to know that the other is alive. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The other flees at your approach. But his knowledge of the local area (and the best places to hide) cannot match yours. You are able to easily follow his trail until he lies exhausted on the roadside. In short order you deliver him to his overjoyed family and reap a rich reward. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
