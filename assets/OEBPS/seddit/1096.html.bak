<p>In a dark corner of a small town, you discover a temple of evil Magian fire-worshippers. In the center of the temple stands an idol of great value.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can steal the idol or alert the Sultan:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you plan to steal the idol</span>: You go to get help. [Go to paragraph <a href="1097.html#TaleHeader">1097</a>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you go to the Sultan</span>: You inform the Sultan of your discovery.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He is furious when he hears the news, and promises you great rewards. However, after his soldiers have destroyed the temple and taken the idol, the Sultan forgets his promise and keeps the treasures he promised to you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You present the news so that many people hear that you were promised a reward. After his soldiers destroy the temple, you receive your just reward. The idol is merely a statue; however, the cushion upon which is rested is a most wondrous bed, made of the skin of an enormous snake. [D+2 / Courtly Graces / Snakeskin Bed]</li>
