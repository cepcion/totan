<p>Hired to help a wealthy merchant move his furniture to another&mdash;larger&mdash;home, you come upon a framed glass mirror in an empty room. As you pick it up your hand slips, but to your amazement instead of crashing into the glass, your hand passes through it!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Where you were expecting pain, now you feel curiosity. You pass your whole body through the glass and stand in a large room, filled with furniture, tapestries, urns, and other large objects to decorate a home. Nothing here appears singularly valuable and you are glad you don&rsquo;t have to move these pieces as part of your job. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Withdrawing your hand, you study the symbols that decorate the frame of the mirror. Deciphering them, you touch one of interest and then pass through the glass. [D+1 / Have another player move you to any Place of Power and have an immediate encounter]</p>
