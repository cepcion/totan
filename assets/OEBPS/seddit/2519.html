<p class="TaleDestiny">(2519) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Inside a remote mountain you have found a strange cave lit from within by glowing moss, illuminating a crystal pool. Standing between you and the pool is a stranger dressed in a loose silk mask embroidered in gold and silver with strange symbols. &ldquo;You have invaded my cave. Come to steal my treasures. You shall never leave to tell others what you have found!&rdquo; Thinking quickly, you offer a bargain. If you succeed at a test of the other&rsquo;s choice, you will be shown the way out. If you fail, whatever fate awaits you is well-deserved. The stranger dances in place. &ldquo;Ah yes, a riddle then?&rdquo; You nod in confirmation. &ldquo;What is earth when carried, fire when lit, air when all is said and done, but becomes useless in water?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You think for a moment, and then grin. &ldquo;I believe you refer to wood.&rdquo; The other cackles maniacally, &ldquo;Wrong!&rdquo; and disappears in a puff of smoke. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: After almost an hour, you address the other, &ldquo;I believe you refer to the only substance that is normally dry like sand, becomes a ball of flame when lit, and merely smokes when consumed. Water can ruin it&hellip; for it is this new creation from the East. Gunpowder.&rdquo; The other nods appreciatively and shows you the way out, granting you one item from his trove before you go. [D+2 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
