<p class="TaleDestiny">(2489) - WEAPON USE  (M), LUCK</p>
<p>One moment, you are on a short trip across a large body of water. The next, you are clinging to a plank with little but your sword and a box of hard tack. You spy a small boat off in the distance. Unfortunately, the person in that boat is worse off than you, and demands that you share what little food you have. You refuse, and a desperate fight ensues. As you are both sun-scorched and malnourished, the fight does not last long.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Refusing to be bested, you push the other into the water. As the body sinks beneath the surface, your conscience cries out in regret. By the time you are rescued by a passing vessel, you are inconsolable. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: When you recover, you decide to share your food. The other offers to alternate rowing with you. You set off, unsure of the direction, but filled with new resolve. In time, you happen across a vessel and are rescued. [D+2 / S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
