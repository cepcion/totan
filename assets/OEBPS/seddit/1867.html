<p class="TaleDestiny">(1867) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You are raising your hand to strike the other when he looks deeply into your eyes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You completely forget what you intended to do. Feeling somewhat foolish, you stammer an apology and wander off, confused.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You realize that the other is trying to use a hypnotic power on you, not unlike that of the dreaded sirens! You remember a tale of sailors blocking their ears against the sirens&rsquo; song, so perhaps the same strategy will work here. You tightly close your eyes&mdash;and feel the other&rsquo;s hold on your mind vanish. It&rsquo;s hard to thrash someone with your eyes closed, but you manage. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
