<p class="TaleDestiny">(2528) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The other has a remarkable collection of swords, one of which you desire greatly. After much haggling, you still cannot agree on a price&mdash;until finally the other issues a challenge: defeat him in combat and the weapon you seek will be yours as a gift.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You accept the challenge and, to no one&rsquo;s surprise, the other beats you easily. &ldquo;You are not worthy of such a fine weapon&mdash;I suggest you pick up a stick.&rdquo; That said, the other turns his back on you. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You accept the challenge and the duel begins. In a matter of seconds, you realize that never before have you seen such display of skill and confidence. Even though you hold your own, you know you cannot hope to win. Drawing back, you place your sword on the ground and compliment the other profusely on his skill. To your astonishment, the other hands you the sword you sought. &ldquo;The blade is a tool not of the arm but of the heart and of the mind. You are wise enough to know when the battle is lost. This will help you when the battle can still be won.&rdquo; [D+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
