<p class="TaleDestiny">(928) - LUCK</p>
<p>From high atop a tree, you look down on a pack of slavering canines clustered around its base. The branch you cling to creaks ominously. All night you pray.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: At midnight the bough shatters. Several dogs get a taste of you before you reach a nearby river and wade across. The dogs do not feel you to be worth their effort to pursue. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Just as the bough is breaking, an antelope darts by. Baying eagerly, the dogs take up the chase. You give thanks for your deliverance and pledge to live a virtuous life. [D+1 / Piety / Lose Stealth and Stealing]</p>
