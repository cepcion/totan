<p class="TaleDestiny">(1380) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You seize the moment and press your offensive. To look at the other is difficult, as you are almost consumed with pity and longing. Just as you make a thrust you stop yourself&mdash;almost uncontrollably. Millimeters from the other&rsquo;s neck, your blade rests with deadly potential.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You drop your blade and ask forgiveness for your trespasses. The other suggests that you raise your plea to the heavens. You do so and the other takes that moment to grab your knife and plunge it into you. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You steel yourself and nick the other on both cheeks. &ldquo;This will be a lesson to you. Don&rsquo;t trifle with the hearts of others.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
