<p>At your approach, the other cries out, &ldquo;I am fated to be the instrument of your doom, foul one!&rdquo; He attacks unerringly, as if Allah Himself guided his blows, while every thrust of yours goes astray.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are grievously wounded, and his final blow is met on your sword&mdash;and both weapons shatter. &ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; he mutters, &ldquo;You shall not die by my hand. But rest assured your fate is known.&rdquo; [D+2 / S+1 / Lose Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You swing wildly, and miraculously his sword shatters at the impact! &ldquo;Ahem,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Perhaps I have&hellip; ah&hellip; misread the signs. How can I atone for my error?&rdquo; He presses coins into your hands, and bows and scrapes and invokes the blessings of the Merciful Lord, and you consider yourself lucky to have turned his wrath into generosity. [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
