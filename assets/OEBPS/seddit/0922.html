<p class="TaleDestiny">(922) - COURTLY GRACES, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You come across a fine horse harried by a pack of wild dogs. Its flanks heave with exertion and its eyes have the stare of panic.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You yell and wave your arms, but the dogs do not stray from their vicious task. After finishing the horse, they eye you speculatively, and you wisely retreat. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: Such a fine horse only needs a skilled rider; properly guided, it is quite capable of defending itself. You dash forward and leap to the horse&rsquo;s back; with your encouragement, the horse gives the dogs more than they can handle. Your valor has won you a fine mount. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
