<p class="TaleDestiny">(1853) - COURTLY GRACES, BEGUILING</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s trade business is failing; though the goods of his people are wondrous, his skills with &ldquo;landlubbers&rdquo; are atrocious. You think that perhaps you can help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is of no use; the other is stubborn, his hatred of the surface people so deep that he cannot hide it. You abandon the other, mourning the loss of potential profit from the business relationship. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, BEGUILING</span>: You are able to help the other&rsquo;s skill in dealing with other people, though you know that it is a facade: he is not fond of surface people and it is hard for him to be nice to them. You are able to make some profit from the relationship, but soon his anger strains your relationship and you decide to leave him before someone does something regrettable. [D+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
