<p class="TaleDestiny">(1193) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You discover the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. With its confines are true mountains of ivory, and you are dazzled by the wealth&hellip; You cannot possibly carry all the tusks from the forest yourself. You return to notify the prince of this land.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You know that the wicked Vizier will council treachery; therefore, you choose to speak to the prince before an open audience, so that all may know that you are the one who discovered the treasure, and thus deserve a handsome reward. The return expedition is a success. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
