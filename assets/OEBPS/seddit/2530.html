<p>Above all else, the other craves knowledge&hellip; but do you have what he needs?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Unfortunately, you don&rsquo;t. The other is disappointed, but he is willing to teach his skills&mdash;for an outrageous sum.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you wish to spend three wealth levels?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Yes</span>: The other is an excellent teacher. [W-3 (Min: Penniless) / Weapon Use]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">No, or you do not have Wealth of Rich or greater</span>: You respectfully decline his terms, and he goes on his way. [S+1]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You immediately begin to discourse on the skies and the earth and the sea, and all the things therein and thereupon&hellip; their comings and goings and their beginnings and ends.
