<p class="TaleDestiny">(2405) - None</p>
<p>Love is stronger than faith and might, as the sight before you proves: a huge &rsquo;efreet being lorded over by a tiny human. In fact, the &rsquo;efreet seems to have no will of its own&mdash;is it ensorcelled? You wait for the creature to be separated from its lover (or master!) and when the opportunity arises, you slap him hard. Nothing. You beat the creature about the chest and head, but nothing changes. Finally, you give up, unsure of what it is that compels the &rsquo;efreet to maintain its loyalty to its human love. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
