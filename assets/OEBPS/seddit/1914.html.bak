<p class="TaleDestiny">(1914) - SEDUCTION, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The haughty attitude of the other forces you to teach him some manners at the end of your stout oaken rod.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give the other a sound beating. You feel much better. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Your first blow knocks the other&rsquo;s turban askew, and you recognize him as a wealthy and powerful merchant! No doubt he is hiding from his enemies and would be delighted to have some friendly company! [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: As you beat the other, you realize that he is a disguised merchant! You offer to help him with his schemes and earn a healthy share of the profits. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
