<p class="TaleDestiny">(1808) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You learn that not all pearl divers are honest, hard-working men. Some of them are thieves! As you emerge from the water with a basket full of pearls, you feel the sharp prick of a knife in your back!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You see no choice. The pearls are not worth your life. You surrender your hard-earned wealth, and the rogue vanishes before you can turn around. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Very carefully and stealthily, you draw your own knife while pretending to turn over the pearls. As soon as the thief grabs your pearl basket, you turn on him and attack! The knife fight is short and vicious, but you are victorious in the end. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
