<p class="TaleDestiny">(2125) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You see the other showing a gem merchant some wondrous jewels from the ocean.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You wait for the merchant to finish the transaction and leave. You stop the other and inform him that the merchant he dealt with is a known thief and that his money is fake. You offer to exchange the fake money with real money and deal with the merchant as he deserves. The other scoffs at your words, citing many years of dealing with the same merchant. You quickly depart before anything untoward happens to you.
[S+1 / Lose Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You tell the other that his jewels are worth far more than the merchant is offering and convince him to come see you for a better price. He does so very soon after, but the price you give him is a knock on the head and a quick escape with his gems. [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / Lose Piety]</p>
