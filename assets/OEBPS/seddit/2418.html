<p>Wails of anguish catch your attention and upon following the lovelorn sounds, you find yourself face to face with a striking but unearthly figure. You are taken aback, but the other makes no threatening gesture. Instead, in tones soft as a whisper, yet clear in your mind, the other tells a tale of her lost love. Seeing an opportunity, you tell her of a human slave of such surpassing beauty and talent that by comparison any lost love could be forgotten. The other brightens at the prospect and asks what is needed. You respond that a slave of such marketable talents will cost a great sum&mdash;plus a commission. You take the money into town and spend a small portion of it on a beggar, along with some clothes and cleaning supplies.
