<p class="TaleDestiny">(1869) - SCHOLARSHIP, SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>When you learned that the other was the leader of a vile Magian cult, you knew that swift action would be needed. When you learned that he also had powers of hypnosis, you understood that it would be dangerous indeed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Trusting to Allah to protect you, you proceed directly to the Magian&rsquo;s lair, weapon in hand. Somehow, you never actually reach it. You don&rsquo;t know how you came to be in this wilderness, but you&rsquo;d best find a way out of it. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You know that hypnotists must be able to look into your eyes in order to mesmerize you. You protect yourself with a cleverly designed mask. When you attack the Magian, his powers cannot prevent his death. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You will have to be careful to approach the Magian unseen, or he will use his powers against you. Fortunately, he lives near a large lake, so you can reach him by boat undetected! Caught by surprise, the other is quickly overcome by your strength of arms. There is no might or glory but in Allah! [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
