<p class="TaleDestiny">(2430) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>When the townsfolk told you their tale of the awful creatures that roam the streets at night, you knew you had to see them for yourself. Secure in your third-story apartment, you watch the street below through the narrowest crack in the shutters.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: If only you had been wise enough to douse your lamp! The shambling forms spy your light and, to your amazement and terror, quickly scramble up the walls of the house to seize you! Now you find yourself one of their number, stumbling along in the dark, seeking victims of your own. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: The twisted forms have discovered you. They begin attacking your house with heavy blows! Terrified, you fling open the shutters to attempt an escape. When you are revealed in all your beauty, they cease their attacks. Soon a crowd has gathered below you, and in the light of the dawn you can see that the monsters are only men, suffering under some terrible spell. You can only hope that the Sultan&rsquo;s viziers can discover a cure. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
