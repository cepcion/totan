<p class="TaleDestiny">(1044) - PIETY</p>
<p>The crew spots a wounded merman and brings him aboard; they intend selling him as a novelty slave. You speak with the merman and find he is an infidel.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You see nothing wrong with their intention, and arrange to aid in the sale for a small percentage. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You tell the merman that if he converts to the True Faith, you will intercede on his behalf. The crew is disappointed, but persuaded by your plea. The grateful merman gives you a small, magical present. [D+2 / S+1 / Dendan Oil]</p>
