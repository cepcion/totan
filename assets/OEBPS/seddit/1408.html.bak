<p class="TaleDestiny">(1408) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>As you copy the names, a jinni arises from the solid stone of the island and demands to know your business.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You grovel before him, and apologize for trespassing on the island. He has mercy on you. Rather than flaying you, he merely beats you and drives you far away. [D+1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You read aloud the names, and the jinni bows before you. &ldquo;Truly, you are my master returned! Is this the Final Day?&rdquo; You tell him it is not, and order him to robe you in finest garments and make ready your return to the lands of the Faithful. [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
