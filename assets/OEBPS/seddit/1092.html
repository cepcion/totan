<p class="TaleDestiny">(1092) - MAGIC</p>
<p>A man strides down the street, bearing a sword which catches the light like a fine diamond. You step clear of him, but a young soldier, more brave than clever, challenges the man to a duel.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The duel is over almost before it begins. Now you can say that you yourself have witnessed the power of the Thunderbolt Sword. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You recognize the power of the sword and intervene, persuading the soldier to put away his pride and apologize. He is initially furious, but soon realizes you have saved his life and thanks you greatly
[D+1 / S+1]</p>
