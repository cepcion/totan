<p class="TaleDestiny">(942) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The egg of a roc is vast, like a huge dome imbedded in the sand.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The egg suddenly cracks open. A shell fragment strikes your head, dazing you, and the young roc emerges. Just as it is about to eat you, the mother returns with food and it turns away. You escape&mdash;barely. [D+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You gather a band of skilled adventurers and return to the egg. When the fledgling bursts from the egg, your men quickly slay it. With haste, you remove the carcass from the mountain. You sell the meat in market, for it is most tasty, and the spectacle of the great bones causes a stir in the court of the Sultan. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
