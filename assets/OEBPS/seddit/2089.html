<p class="TaleDestiny">(2089) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me&hellip; if you dare!&rdquo; cries the captain. Holding his blade clenched between his teeth, he grabs a dangling rope and swings acrobatically to the neighboring boat. As you watch, he lands gracefully, brandishes his blade and leaps howling into the fray!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: This sort of thing is really not your specialty. You are, however, more than happy to help from just where you are. You grab a bow and lay down fire for the fearless captain and his motley band of corsairs.
[D+1 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: &ldquo;Allah,&rdquo; you shout, grasping the rope in both hands, &ldquo;In my time of need, lend me your strength and courage&hellip; and if it&rsquo;s not too much trouble, your mercy!&rdquo; You swing valiantly over the water and crash onto the other ship, drawing your blade at once and fighting at your captain&rsquo;s side until the day is won. [D+2 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
