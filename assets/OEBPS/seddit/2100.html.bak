<p class="TaleDestiny">(2100) - FATED (M), BLESSED (M)</p>
<p>Riding hard to escape from brigands, you are ill-prepared for the sudden force that tears you from the saddle. Like the hand of an invisible giant, this great force hurls you through the air to slam into the cliffs of a mysterious mountain. The force of the Magnetic Mountain is too great for you to break free. In despair, you pray to almighty Allah for deliverance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Through deductive reasoning, you realize that it is the metal you carry that is attracted to the mountain. With great effort, you divest yourself of your metal possessions&mdash;and finally you free yourself. [S+1 / W-1
(Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED, BLESSED  (All mandatory)</span>: Hours later, as thirst begins to rob you of your sense, an old hermit approaches you. He tells you a tale of the rewards reserved for the greedy, and tells you that like the virtuous man you must rid yourself of corrupting wealth in order to survive. With his aid, you cast aside your metal possessions and are freed. [S+1 / Piety]</p>
