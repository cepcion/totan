<p class="TaleDestiny">(1819) - MAGIC</p>
<p>Leaning against a tree is a man feverish from poison. It is clear that he will soon expire if you do not aid him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You know that it is too late to save this man with simple medicine, so you use your mystical arts to save his life. When the devout dervish learns what you have done on his behalf, he curses you for corrupting his body with your black magic! [S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
