<p>The other comes to you as one in need and says that one of your skills can certainly be of great assistance. You are eager to help out if it will relieve the other&rsquo;s distress. With haste, the other leads you out of town&hellip; to a burial-ground. &ldquo;Grab up a shovel&mdash;I need three fresh bodies for my experiments!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cry out in revulsion at the monstrosity you have been asked to perform. The other looks surprised and, with a sad shake of the head, says, &ldquo;I thought I had found a true partner in my great work. Be gone with you.&rdquo; With that, you are&hellip; somewhere else. [S+1 / Have another player move you to any space except a Place of Power]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You stifle a cry of revulsion and pick up a shovel as you were told. When the other turns away from you, you strike him with every scrap of force you can summon, splitting his head like a melon. Thus always to those who would blaspheme the dead! [D+1 / Piety]</p>
