<p class="TaleDestiny">(1290) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You hide, but to no avail. A shadow descends from the ceiling, and before you stands a deadly-looking &rsquo;efreet!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: His hands close about your throat. You choke out, &ldquo;Allah preserve me!&rdquo; He stumbles back, and you seize the opportunity to flee.
[D+1 / S+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: He studies your face &ldquo;Are you not he whom I have named?&rdquo; You admit who you are and he smiles. &ldquo;Your father was a powerful enchanter. He bequeathed this money to you through me.&rdquo; A pile of gold appears at your feet, and the &rsquo;efreet is gone! [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
