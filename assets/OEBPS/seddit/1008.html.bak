<p class="TaleDestiny">(1008) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other is blind and his senses are heightened. &ldquo;Where are you going young traveler?&rdquo; he asks. You continue on your way hoping he thinks that you did not hear him. &ldquo;Your selfish nature is shameful, young one. A curse on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your body seizes up from a tight pain. The pain comes and goes as you travel making you think often of the promise of Allah&rsquo;s mercy. [S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You notice that the being has a rare garment of great value. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you say. &ldquo;I do wish to help you.&rdquo; Thus saying, you tell the other of the value of his garment, of which he was previously unaware. He is impressed that you did not try to trick him out of it, and he gives you the blessings of Allah. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
