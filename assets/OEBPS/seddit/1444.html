<p class="TaleDestiny">(1444) - QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>You realize that the other is trying to deceive you, and you attempt to turn the tables on him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your effort fails, and the other is annoyed at you. A whispered incantation, a subtle gesture, and *poof* &mdash; you wag your tail and bark!
[D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span> [1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You so cleverly contrive to reverse the deception that the other is greatly amused, although he is the butt of your joke! He grants you a great boon, and tells all of your great skill. [D+2 / S+2 / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> Your effort fails, and the other is annoyed at you. A whispered incantation, a subtle gesture, and *poof* &mdash; nothing happens, for the power of the Protective Talisman turns aside his spell! The other is most impressed, and you converse long into the night. [D+1 / Magic]</p>
