<p class="TaleDestiny">(2269) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>After you have finished beating the other, he appears to be calmed somewhat. You later discover him using your punishment to earn pity from the Vizier.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You go before the Vizier to plead your case, but he feels that you have been rather too harsh on this mad being. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You recognize the shrewdness of the other in turning adversity to advantage. You go to the Vizier and plead that the other is certainly not as mad as he seems, given how clearly he is turning his beating to his advantage. The Vizier sees your point and throws the other in the stocks. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
