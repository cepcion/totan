<p class="TaleDestiny">(1499) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The other draws a sword from out of his bedrolls. &ldquo;I was once the greatest sword master in all the world. No matter how destitute I become I could never sell my best sword. Now you will feel its bite!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You drop your sword and beg to be spared, saying that you, too, are destitute and that you only attacked him out of desperation. The other is touched by your tale and says, &ldquo;You are still young. You could join an army. Let me teach you to fight and it will make me feel whole as well.&rdquo; [S+1 / Weapon Use / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other circles you for a bit and then says, &ldquo;You move like a warrior, but you will still be no match for me.&rdquo; He strikes and you battle as best you can. You eventually best him as he tires from malnutrition. As he falls to the ground you are beset with grief and decide to restore him back to health. He is grateful and teaches you all he knows.
