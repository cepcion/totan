<p class="TaleDestiny">(998) - PIETY</p>
<p>You see an emaciated man wagering on a dice game.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Afraid of being cheated, you refuse to participate, though you become the object of some good-natured jeering. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You give the man a coin, saying, &ldquo;If you are in such need of money that you do this to your brothers, you are in greater need than I.&rdquo; The other man is shamed and abandons his game. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
