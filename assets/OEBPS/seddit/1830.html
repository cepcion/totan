<p class="TaleDestiny">(1830) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Half-dead from thirst, you did not notice anything strange about the oasis you stumbled into. But as soon as you drink the sweet, cold water, you feel a feverish chill. When the tingling fades, you find that your gender has been changed! You hasten to a cousin&rsquo;s home in a nearby village and implore him for assistance.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He provides you with clothes suitable to your new condition and help you create a new identity. A couple weeks of this and you&rsquo;ve learned more about the opposite sex than you ever hoped to. This inside information could prove very useful if you ever recover.
