<p>At the sound of horsemen approaching, you cautiously take cover. From your place of concealment, you witness a troop of dark, shadowy cavalry passing, their faces obscured by a mist.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pray for safety, but the sound of your voice attracts the attention of the lead horseman. His followers gather around you, grinning&mdash;they are a tribe of evil Magian fire-worshippers! They strip you and brand your body with tattoos and shower curses on you before they ride off, laughing. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Composed and calm, you stay hidden as they ride to their hiding place. They are merely men&mdash;wicked fire-worshippers, but men. Your make haste to the Sultan, and he brings swift justice upon these evil unbelievers. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>] (1 turn)]</p>
