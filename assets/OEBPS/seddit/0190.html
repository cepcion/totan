<p class="TaleDestiny">(190) - PIETY</p>
<p>The imprisoned one is quite despairing, and your words do nothing to improve his condition. &ldquo;You cannot help me, I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Taking him at his word, you depart. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You refuse to despair, saying, &ldquo;If the One God wills your freedom, nothing can hold you.&rdquo; You discourse from the Koran and on the Sunnah, and your words from the Prophet show the imprisoned one his fate in a new light, and his spirits are lifted. You are now armed with new weapons against despair. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
