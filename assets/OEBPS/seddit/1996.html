<p class="TaleDestiny">(1996) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>In a renowned tea house, you encounter a well-dressed merchant boasting of his new trade route and the monies it will pay those who invest with him. However, you suspect he is lying&mdash;you know the route he describes passes through an area overrun with mermen. You respectfully join the conversation, presenting yourself as an enthusiastic investor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: No one is impressed by your inclusion in the circle of listeners. The merchant quickly tires of your presence and excuses himself. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Because of your fine bearing and eloquent conversation, the listeners come to believe that an incognito noble is highly interested in the merchant&rsquo;s proposition, which is wiser than it originally seemed. Money flows in and the merchant invites you to his home. [D+1 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
