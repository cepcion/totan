<p class="TaleDestiny">(2035) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You have been captured by brigands! The vile slavers toss you and a number of other poor innocents into the lower reaches of a cavernous complex far from civilization. Over-confident, your oafish jailor succumbs to drink and loses consciousness. You rally the other prisoners and attempt an escape. The bulk of the bandits are closer to the surface, so your only route is deeper into the caves. In time you reach a dead end, and the running boots of the alerted slavers begin to echo closer! Your footsteps sound hollowly on the floor. Scrambling madly, you and the others dig in the dirt and discover a large trapdoor, held closed by a jeweled clasp. You open it to find food, weapons, and treasure&hellip; but no escape.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You and your companions surrender to the slavers. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Propping the old wooden door open with barrels of foodstuffs, you hand out weapons. On your orders, the prisoners take up defensive positions behind the cover of the raised trapdoor. So fortified, you fight off the initial assault. The bandits also realize they can&rsquo;t starve you out because you have plentiful provisions. A day later, they fall to fighting among themselves. In a week, you are free to return to your travels. [D+2 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
