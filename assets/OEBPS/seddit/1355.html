<p class="TaleDestiny">(1355) - LUCK</p>
<p>You enter the valley, avoiding vipers at every step. You collect many diamonds, then wait for the carcasses to fall. Finally a large sheep is thrown into the valley, and you climb aboard. A roc swoops down and carries you off.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The roc leaves you on a ledge beyond the reach of the hunters. You get their attention by throwing diamonds, few of which you recover after your rescue. Still, you count yourself fortunate for your plans to have gone even this well. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Everything goes perfectly, and you descend from the mountain with ease; your diamonds command a fine price. [D+2 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Fabulous) / Giant Diamond]</p>
