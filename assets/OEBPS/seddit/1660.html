<p class="TaleDestiny">(1660) - PIETY</p>
<p>As you kneel before the other, you sense ill omens hanging about him. You fear that they may encompass you as well, and beg the other for forgiveness and to be spared.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other knows that his fate is coming and is resolved to face it with dignity. After accompanying you for a while, he is killed in a freak accident. Though you do not share his fate, you soon feel that an ill wind is blowing your way. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You pray for his fate to be changed, but preferably at a safe distance. Though you never see him again, you feel as though you have made a difference and spared him his fate. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
