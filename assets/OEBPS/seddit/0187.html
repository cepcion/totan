<p class="TaleDestiny">(187) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You speak to the other. Before you have finished a sentence, he cries, &ldquo;Be silent!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Get away, worm!&rdquo; The other seems enraged at your presumption and you make haste to be elsewhere. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: &ldquo;Your words are poorly timed and show want of sense, but the perfection of your form nonetheless gives me some comfort. Let me teach you of proper deference to your superiors.&rdquo; You return to the dwelling of the other, and your lessons continue long into the night. [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
