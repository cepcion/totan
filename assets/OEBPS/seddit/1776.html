<p class="TaleDestiny">(1776) - LUCK</p>
<p>Your gracious host has invited you to explore all but one of the one hundred rooms in his palace. You delight in examining room after room, quickly losing count of how many rooms you had reached. Finally you reach the most magnificent door in the palace. Is it the hundredth door?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Not wanting to offend your generous host, you give a prayer of thanks for the wonders you have seen and give up your exploration of the palace. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
