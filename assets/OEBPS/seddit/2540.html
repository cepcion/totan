<p class="TaleDestiny">(2540) - BEGUILING, MARRIED  (M)</p>
<p>When you saw the kindly one sitting on a cushion at the inn, you were intrigued. &ldquo;Might I accompany you during your evening meal?&rdquo; In conversation, you learn that the other&rsquo;s children are greedy and plan to take over the world. The other mentions magical artifacts, the service of a dozen jinn and &rsquo;efreet, an army of children warriors, and something called a &ldquo;Derobulator.&rdquo; The only way to prevent this horrible future is to make sure that the other&rsquo;s considerable wealth is kept out of the hands of the children. The comely one suggests that the two of you marry, so that you would control the fortune. You decide to aid this poor suffering mad one.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You marry. The children see this as a corrupt ploy to gain wealth on your part. Soon the entire region knows of your money-grubbing deception. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Luckily, you were blessed with more than your share of charm. Despite their misgivings, the other&rsquo;s children cannot help but like you, and you them. When the sad day arrives that the other passes on, you donate the money to the local mosque&hellip; and receive a blessing in return. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MARRIED  (mandatory):</span> You tell the other of your dear spouse, awaiting you at home, and instead connive  with the other a most wondrous scheme that will show the children the folly of all those who crave power more than love. In the end, the children are chastened and rededicate their energies to the benefit of their family and all around them. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
