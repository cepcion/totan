<p class="TaleDestiny">(1727) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Seeing that the poor villagers cannot hope to overcome the mighty apes, you say to the Prince, &ldquo;We have no choice but to await the whim of Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The villagers are not impressed by your call for piety, and your prayers have no noticeable affect on the apes. You decide to leave the village before they grow impatient with you. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Despite the villagers&rsquo; lack of support, you set down to pray in the center of the village. That night, the apes return to hoot and holler around you. After many hours, they are impressed by your endurance and depart, leaving the village in peace. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
