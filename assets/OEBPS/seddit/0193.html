<p class="TaleDestiny">(193) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, BRASS TRUMPET  (M)</p>
<p>Before you can act upon your decision, you find that the other is not the noble person you thought, but a wicked trickster.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The false other calls his servants and has you imprisoned, that you may tell none of his deception. [D+1 /<span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The false other has you locked away, but your noble bearing and dignity in the face of adversity softens the heart of your hunchbacked jailer, and you are permitted to escape. As you flee, you learn that the false other has you declared an outlaw. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> As you approach the other, the Brass Trumpet sounds out a note of warning, the sound of which strikes the other with great force. While he recovers from the sound, you flee to safety. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
