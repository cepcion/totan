<p class="TaleDestiny">(2135) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The local slaves spread rumors of a nearby haunted ruin. Though others scoff at their tales, you are determined to explore them. You find a ruined city half buried in sand, the buildings toppled and pitted. Greedy for lost treasure, you spend the day wandering the ruins. That night, mournful shades appear, performing common tasks as if they were still living. While they re-enact their former lives, they sing a dirge. The sound places a heavy burden on your soul, and you are dispirited.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You soon quit the unhappy place, convinced that whatever treasures exist are unattainable. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Calling upon all your courage and resolve, you spend several nights in the city studying the ghosts. At one point during the night, all the ghosts pause in their labors to turn their faces to one part of the city. In that location, you find an odd blue stone that emanates an un-holiness. You strike it with your axe and break it into a million pieces. A light fills the place and the ghosts fade, smiling at last.
