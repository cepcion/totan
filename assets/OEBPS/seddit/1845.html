<p class="TaleDestiny">(1845) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You hear a scream of terror from the other side of the brush. You run to investigate and see a woman running with a child in her arms. Behind her you see a frightening sight: a rhino charging straight towards her!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You remember hearing that the rhino has poor eyesight but magnificent hearing. You hope that you might be able to distract the beast by making loud noises. Yelling at the woman to be quiet, you shout and holler and throw rocks towards the charging rhino. The confused beast is fooled by your noise, and charges towards you instead. Fortunately, you are able to dive into a shallow ravine and the half-blind animal continues charging into the plain. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Drawing your bow, you fire an arrow towards the rampaging beast. It glances off the creature&rsquo;s armored hide, barely scratching the surface. Apparently, the unexpected pain is enough to distract it from its course, and the woman escapes while the puzzled creature tries to locate the cause of the pain. [S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
