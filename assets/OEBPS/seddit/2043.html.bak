<p class="TaleDestiny">(2043) - LUCK, MAGIC</p>
<p>As you cross a great desert, you become lost. One evening, as the sun sets, it leaves a burning pyre on the horizon. With nowhere else to go, you approach it. A mighty marid is encased in the fire. In a booming voice, he asks that you free him by using the remainder of your water on the flames.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You can do so, or leave the being to his prison:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you walk back into the desert</span>: A few days later, you arrive at a settlement. You tell your tale, but few believe you. [S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you douse the flames</span>: The grateful efreet gifts you with a magical ring. &ldquo;Put it on and it will take you any place your heart desires.&rdquo; You slip the ring over your finger, and a dozen doors appear in the sand. The marid vanishes, leaving behind an echoing laughter.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pick a door at random and enter. It takes you home to Baghdad. [D+1 / Move to Baghdad]</li>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You consider all the places you would like to visit, envision one of them, and step through a door. It takes you to a fine home there. The slaves bow down to you as their new master. [D+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Move to any city space]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Studying the ring and the glowing portals, you understand a great deal about the magic inherent in them. Confident in your power, you step through the least of the doors, arriving in the fabled City of Brass. [D+2 / Seal Ring / Move to the <a href="0177.html#TaleHeader">City of Brass</a> and have an immediate encounter]</li>
</ul>
