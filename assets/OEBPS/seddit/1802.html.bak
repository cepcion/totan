<p>The sounds of angry men can be heard over the next hill. When you go to investigate, you see a band of spearmen poking and prodding at an enormous black-skinned man trapped under a net.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you come to the aid of the unfortunate giant?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If yes</span>: The warriors are surprised that anyone would come to the aid of the giant they had worked so hard to capture. The giant is also surprised, but not enough not to lash out in the confusion you created. Freed from the net, he quickly overwhelms the soldiers. He is grateful for your assistance, and gives you a pouch of gems. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If no</span>: You watch as the soldiers bind the mighty giant. One of the spearmen tells you of the giant&rsquo;s cannibalistic ways, and you know you were right not to intervene. [D+1 / S+1]</li>
