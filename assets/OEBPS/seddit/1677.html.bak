<p>A prince of the jinni walks among humans on important business of state. He seeks to capture a band of wicked jinn who are preying on mankind.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you volunteer, you are not much help against the marids, and the prince is distracted by the need to repeatedly save your life. Afterwards, he thanks you and gives you a small reward, but it is clear that he is not impressed with you. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You volunteer your skill with the blade, and teach him many lessons not just of arms but of strategy and tactics. With your teachings filling his ears, he sees how to turn the monsters against each other and conquer them one by one. As he goes off, he gives you a great reward. [D+2 / Treasure]</p>
