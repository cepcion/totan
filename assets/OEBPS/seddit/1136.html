<p class="TaleDestiny">(1136) - WEAPON USE, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You are forced to bed down in an abandoned house for the night. As you prepare your bed, you find a particularly interesting trinket in the detritus and decide to be off with it. The trouble is, while the house was abandoned, you were not the only person to choose it as a shelter&mdash;and as you turn, the other looms before you.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may either attack the other or plea for leniency:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you attack</span>:</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is a skilled swordsman and cuts you several times. You begin to wonder why he does not just finish you. You drop your sword and fall to your knees, ready to die. The other says, &ldquo;Oh no&mdash;I will not kill you. I will let you live to repent your wrong-doings in the world. Now get out!&rdquo; And he grabs you and tosses you out in the street, slamming the door behind you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: The other is quite skillful and you each see that the fight is going to last some time. After a riposte he steps back and says, &ldquo;Wait. We will destroy this house. I will make a bargain with you. I will let you go if you will stop fighting.&rdquo; Not sure that you would defeat him, you take your chance to escape. [S+1]</li>
</ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you plea for leniency</span>:</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Your kind should have their hands cut off&mdash;and sewn back on to be cut off again!&rdquo; The other takes you by sword-point to the city guards. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other melts when looking deep into your eyes. He cannot harm one such as you. He cannot have you stealing from him either. He blindfolds you and has you taken deep into the woods&mdash;where, exactly, you do not know. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</li>
</ul>
