<p class="TaleDestiny">(2298) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You stop to ask for directions to the next town, but clearly the one you are asking is quite mad.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are sure that the other has some kind of secret to share. No one gets this mad without some great event in his past. You query him further and further until you are quite spent. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Just when you start to make sense from the ramblings of the other, his keeper comes to collect him. He calls the other by a nickname&mdash;one that you recognize from legends of ancient places. You use this information to press further and in a moment of lucidity, the other gives you just enough information that you can piece together the puzzle.
