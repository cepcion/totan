<p class="TaleDestiny">(1944) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You have learned that your good friend, the prince Taj el Mulouk, was expelled from the Islands of Camphor by the jealous Sultan when he learned of his daughter&rsquo;s love for the prince. You cannot bear to see your friend suffer away from his beloved, so you devise a scheme to reunite them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Sailing to the island, you are met by the Sultan&rsquo;s fleet, which is determined to block you from landing. You launch a bold attack, but the prince&rsquo;s small crew is no match for such a large fleet. You are forced to retreat. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: The Sultan of the Islands of Camphor defends his realm with a mighty fleet, and you know that the prince has not earned the loyalty of enough men to fight them face-to-face. However, you know of a hidden (but dangerous!) passage to an undefended part of the island. It takes all of your skill as a sailor, but you and your friend land  safely near the palace. [D+1 / S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
