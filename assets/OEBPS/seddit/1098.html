<p class="TaleDestiny">(1098) - STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>A lovely maiden wearing a beautiful ring is accompanied by a burly slave. You give a street-youth a coin to distract the slave so that you might steal the ring.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You snatch the ring. However, the slave stops you. Behind him is the child, gleefully clutching the two coins he received for betraying you! You are thrown into prison, where you have time to contemplate your folly. [D-1 / S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING</span>: You spin a fanciful tale to the child, disguising the true reason you wish the child to distract the slave. In this manner you protect yourself from being betrayed and obtain the ring.
