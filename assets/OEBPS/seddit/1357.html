<p class="TaleDestiny">(1357) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You avoid the serpents and gather many diamonds. Then you find a fabulous green gem. Content with your haul, you wait for a carcass, which you ride up. You display the gem, and the onlookers gasp. This is the Gem of the Sultans, lost years ago. The Sultan of this land greatly desires its return.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is taken from you with promises of lavish rewards. You spend many weeks attending the court of the Sultan, flattering his courtiers and bribing his grandees, but the reward never comes. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your prestige assures you of proper treatment. When the old Sultan dies without an heir, the One who found the Gem is made Sultan. [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
