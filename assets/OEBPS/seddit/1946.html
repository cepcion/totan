<p class="TaleDestiny">(1946) - WISDOM</p>
<p>Distraught by his love-sick heart, your dear friend prince Taj el Mulouk devises a mad plan to seize the focus of his desires, the beautiful princess Dunya, by force. Before you know what has happened, you find yourself at your friend&rsquo;s side, sword in hand, facing the menacing soldiers of the Islands of Camphor.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Clearly, two swordsmen stand no chance against so many, but the madness of your friend infects you as well, and together you launch an attack that poets will remember for ages. Though the outcome is never in doubt, the obvious insanity of the maneuver somehow earns you both an unexpected clemency. [S+1 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You take one look at the assembled army before you and know that your friend&rsquo;s life will be forfeit if you attack. Whispering a prayer for forgiveness, you step behind your good friend, and bringing the pommel of your blade down upon his head, render him unconscious. You hope that when he awakes, he will see the wisdom of your action and find it in his heart to forgive you. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
