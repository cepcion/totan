<p>The other&rsquo;s hapless condition moves you to anger.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You berate him mercilessly, hoping to shame him into respecting himself more. The silence of the other leaves you with the hope that he may have heard you. Sometime later your paths cross again. By virtue of hard work and determination, the other has come back to an honorable position, and he heaps rewards upon you for your help. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You cuff him repeatedly while berating him for the condition he has gotten himself into. The weight of your words strikes truer than your blows and the other breaks into a tumult of tears, swearing to heed your words. A crowd observes your treatment of the other and spreads the tale of the wisdom of your words. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
