<p class="TaleDestiny">(2068) - LUCK</p>
<p>The caravan you are traveling with stops for the night alongside another caravan, one filled with travelers from the East. They build a large communal fire and invite everyone to make merry.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Having heard the stories of ways of these people, you pray to Allah to guide and protect your caravan-mates from the temptations and excesses of the evening. You forget to include yourself in the prayer, however, and you wake the next morning with a terrible headache and substantially fewer coins. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The travelers need supplies and your caravan needs funds, so you pray to Allah for good fortune and partake in their games of chance. To the surprise of all assembled, you actually win more than you lose! [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
