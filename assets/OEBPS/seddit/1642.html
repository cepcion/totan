<p class="TaleDestiny">(1642) - PIETY</p>
<p>The other has been confined by a fellow sorcerer to a small bottle that you happen to find sitting on the shelf of a merchant&rsquo;s stall. Answering your kind words, he calls upon you to be his savior. The bottle is impossible to break, but if you but pray as fervently as you can in front of him, the force of your faith can free him from his prison.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You throw yourself to the ground to pray, but the shopkeeper hears you and chases you off. When you return to the shop later, the bottle is gone. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You call out for the other to go free, if it be Allah&rsquo;s will. The bottle glows and hums with a soft light as cracks and seams form, before shattering across the room. The other expands to normal size, and uses his power to destroy the shop where he has languished for so long. For freeing him, he offers to deliver you to anywhere you choose. [D+1 / Move to any city of your choice]</p>
