<p class="TaleDestiny">(2290) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You hope that this other will use his wealth and influence to aid you, but for now you will present yourself as one wishing to help him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other enjoys making you grovel for a bit and lets you assist him in some of his dealings. He shortly discovers that your true end is to take advantage of his good position. Righteous or not in your process, the other is still taken aback by this and dismisses you. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: As you speak, you tell the other of your many travels across the oceans. The other is delighted and impressed by your adventures. He demands that you tell tales of your journeys; after an evening of sharing tales, he agrees to assist you with some portion of the monies under his command.
