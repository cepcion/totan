<p class="TaleDestiny">(2045) - SEDUCTION, MAGIC</p>
<p>Last night, you had the most wondrous dream. In it, you chased an enchanting being, the sum of all your earthly desires. You glided through a glorious garden with brilliant flowers entwined about the trees and running along the ground. Multicolored birds flew and sang cheerful songs. After a breathtaking pursuit, you caught your love in a pleasant meadow. As you bent to give the other a kiss, you found yourself holding a strangely glowing tiara. A voice sounded, &ldquo;Come to me, my love. Use the crown.&rdquo; When you awoke, you found a beaten tin headpiece among your things. Thinking of the dream, you wonder if it could be the tiara.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Donning the item, you are transported to the beauteous garden. There you find your love waiting for you. You are not skilled or experienced enough to give pleasure, however: The landscape dissolved and you are left bereft. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You place the item on your brow and the world around you transforms. You re-enact your chase and capture. When you kiss your love, it is but the first of many. Your night of bliss is extraordinary. You awaken to find the headband gone. In the days that come, however, you notice you now possess an easy way with people. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You recognize the power inherent in the meager item. You bring the headpiece to the Sultan and explain the pleasure it can grant to those of sufficient skill. He is greatly pleased by your knowledge, ability, and fealty. He names you Vizier. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
