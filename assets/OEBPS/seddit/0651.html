<p class="TaleDestiny">(651) - LUCK</p>
<p>The water smells bitter and unpleasant.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It tastes that way, too. As you wipe your mouth, you notice that your arm is covered with dense red fur! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Just as you are about to drink, a lizard crawls to the water&rsquo;s edge and laps at it. Before your eyes, it turns into a mouse, which squeaks piteously at you before scuttling away. You thank Allah for sending you this warning, and take a vial of the water away with you, to use its magic power elsewhere. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
