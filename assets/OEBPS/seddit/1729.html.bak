<p class="TaleDestiny">(1729) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>After considering the villagers&rsquo; plight for many hours, you realize that you have no answer. Your mind blank, you pray to Allah the Merciful for aid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Torrential rains flood the area around the village, forming a shallow lake. Being unable to swim, the apes cannot reach the villagers. The large supply of boats owned by the villagers allow them to travel the lake and return to the safety of their village with ease. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You realize that it is folly to stay in a village that is attacked by apes every night. Under cover of darkness, you acquire a small boat and make for a nearby island and freedom. [S+1]</p>
