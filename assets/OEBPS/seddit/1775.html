<p class="TaleDestiny">(1775) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Ah, the cruelty of small men! Somehow, this village of savages has captured a noble lion. Having lashed the pitiful creature to a wooden stake, they make sport of teasing and torturing him. How can you stand by and allow such a regal animal be mistreated thus?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Pulling out your bow, you bend an arrow to your ear and take careful aim. The dart whistles through the air, slicing through the lion&rsquo;s tether. Suddenly free, the lion lashes out at the surprised savages. Now the tables have turned! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You quickly identify the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of the great beast. After some haggling, you convince him to sell you the animal for a bag of ducats. You lead the lion out of the village and release it. To your surprise, he follows you. Soon you discover that you have a new loyal companion. [D+1 / S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
