<p class="TaleDestiny">(2459) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You have stumbled across the nest of a mighty roc, the lone egg gleaming in the sun. But you are not alone: a band of robbers approaches, intent on stealing the egg. How can you allow such a noble creature to be enslaved by such ruffians?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You stand upon the egg, your blade in hand. The robbers laugh as they overwhelm you, leaving you battered in the now-empty nest. [S+1 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You cannot hope to overcome the robbers with violence, so you choose trickery. Disguising yourself as one of their band, you whisper lies in their ears. Before long, you are able to turn them on each other! [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
