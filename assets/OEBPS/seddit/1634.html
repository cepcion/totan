<p class="TaleDestiny">(1634) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You come to a city that is exceedingly poor. Lined up on every street are throngs of beggars who want some of your coin. Up ahead you see a humble looking other conjuring bits of food for some beggars. However, there is no way they can feed this many people alone, and you offer to help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Before you can do anything, a crowd of beggars begin to gather around you. You feel parts of your clothing being torn away and you know that if you stay, you will suffer serious injury. Lashing out in defense, you are able to escape the crowd, into the arms of the other. The other pushes you behind him to keep you out of harm&rsquo;s way. Soon, order is restored, but you realize this is not a burden you should take on and that you should leave the city. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: While you do what you can, during a respite, you take the other aside and explain to him that if he goes on aiding the beggars in this way, they will never learn to better themselves. These people must try to help themselves, you tell the other, rather than rely solely on the kindness of others. The other agrees with you and together you leave the city. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
