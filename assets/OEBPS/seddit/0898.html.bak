<p class="TaleDestiny">(898) - WEAPON USE  (M), QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You have come across a strange beast. Although you approach it with careful steps and making calm sounds, when you draw near, it suddenly charges.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You flee, but it catches you easily, knocking you to the ground. In terror, you await its terrible jaws&hellip; but it merely stands over you for a number of minutes, then moves peaceably away. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> You stand your ground and draw your sword, slashing it across the forequarters. A cut so deep would, you are sure, have felled a lion&mdash;but the beast does not yield, and presses its attack with the force of a thunderstorm, relentless and savage&hellip; You barely survive the battle. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You drop to the ground, feigning death. Puzzled, the creature nuzzles at you, stands over you for a few minutes, and at last wanders away. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
