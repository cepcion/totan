<p class="TaleDestiny">(1983) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You are sailing around a volcanic island at a safe distance when you see some figures on the shore, waving for help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You approach as near as you dare so the castaways can swim out to meet you. One of them is a poet, and his gratitude for your bravery inspires him to write an epic poem about you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Your skill and daring are enough to bring your ship nearly to the shore. With the help of your boats, you rescue the people and most of their belongings, before the falling ash of the volcano forces you to withdraw. In return for your kindness, they reward you generously. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
