<p class="TaleDestiny">(423) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>As you approach, the other gestures magically and you are lifted and hurled into an old well. &ldquo;There you shall stay until I choose to release you! Perhaps I shall have my servants bring you a morsel of bread every now and then.&rdquo; The other laughs maniacally and leaves.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: True to his word, he does not let you stable, but it is a long while before you are freed. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: The rough walls of the well provide ample purchase for one of your talents. You scramble out like the accomplished burglar you are. [D+1 / S+2]</p>
