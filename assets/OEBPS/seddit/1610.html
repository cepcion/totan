<p class="TaleDestiny">(1610) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The other&rsquo;s passions have driven him to desperation and seems to be looking to involve you with future escapades in some way. You try to avoid the situation but you keep being drawn in. Eventually you see an opportunity to trap the other and have justice brought down with a heavy hand.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You go along and assist with the ill-founded plans of the other, all the while concealing that you are going to call out the charade at the right moment. Just when the stage is set and there is no escaping the evidence, you bring in the Sultan&rsquo;s soldiers to arrest them both. You are praised for stopping an infidel and are rewarded. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You agree to help. Through clever manipulations and disguises, you arrange to be the one the other finds in the bed chamber. You are not alone, however, as you have also arranged for the Sultan&rsquo;s soldiers to be hiding in the shadows. The scoundrel is arrested and you are praised and rewarded. [W+1 (Max: Rich) / Seduction]</p>
