<p class="TaleDestiny">(2025) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You are enjoying a sweet cup of Turkish coffee in a busy local restaurant. All seats are occupied excepting only the one other at your table, and an elderly man dressed in scholar&rsquo;s robes asks if he might impose on your reflections. You welcome the sage and attempt to engage him in conversation. Anxious to hear of his studies, you say, &ldquo;I pray to Allah that we might become better acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your persistent questions and overbearing piety soon wear on the old man. He excuses himself and hurries out of the establishment.
[D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: You pass a pleasant afternoon in the old man&rsquo;s company. He is clearly taken with your appearance, grace, and manners. He has learned much over the years and is happy to teach one so endearing as you. [D+1 / S+2 / Scholarship]</p>
