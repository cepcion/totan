<p class="TaleDestiny">(1120) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>They lash you to a wooden stake and let the sun and insects do their work on you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you pass out, they realize you are a weakling and leave you to your fate. You come face to face with the Despoiler of Mansions before you manage to free yourself. For days you drag yourself forward until you come to a camp of nomads. You collapse before explaining your presence. When you awaken, your pains are abated, though you are still battered and bruised. They know of the bandits in the area and treat you as best they can. [D+2 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You refuse to let these bandits see your suffering, and you sneer, laugh, and tell ribald jokes. Impressed with your fortitude, they take you into their band. [S+1 / D+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0175.html#TaleHeader">Cave of Wonders</a>]</p>
