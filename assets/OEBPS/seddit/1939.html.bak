<p>Hiring someone who has been possessed by the spirit of an &rsquo;efreet does have some advantages.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The enormous strength of the other allows him to carry extremely large loads. Together you make a fine profit. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: With the superhuman powers of the other, you are able to travel through areas normally impassable. With your knowledge of the region, you can deliver goods twice as fast as any other merchant. You quickly amass a large fortune, but a few days later the other disappears without a trace. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You have heard legends of the lands of the &rsquo;efreet, and you are determined to see them for yourself. Using your charms, you entice the spirit into showing you the way. [S+1 / Move to the <a href="0182.html#TaleHeader">Dusky Land</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
