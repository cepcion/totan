<p>&ldquo;Honor me, do you? If you truly wish to honor me then you will help me with a little scheme I have.&rdquo; The other explains that you will be only temporarily turned into an ape so that you can sneak onto an evil Vizier&rsquo;s property and take back a stolen statue from his gardens. If you are caught, the groundsmen will think nothing of an animal in the garden and will simply shoo you away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You listen to the scheme and it seems quite reasonable to you. You go along with it only to find that there is nothing temporary about your condition. You cannot demand your share of the reward as no one will listen to one who has been seemingly so punished by Allah. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You make a small alteration to the plan&mdash;you will wear an ape costume instead. You are indeed spotted by the groundsmen but they pay you no mind. They don&rsquo;t even shoo you away. Seeing you near the statue the groundsmen begin to talk about its value. When they leave you steal the statue and bring it back to the other, prepared to renegotiate now that you know the true value of the thing. [S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
