<p class="TaleDestiny">(1602) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Standing your ground, you offer your assistance to the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;A mortal who dares to speak to one of the dusky race must be a complete stranger to fear&mdash;and to sense. I respect that and leave you be.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: &ldquo;How can you be of aid to such a one as I?&rdquo; the other demands to know. You weave a string of tales, some light-hearted and some quite dramatic: they are the stories of your own adventures. Time marches on and exhaustion thickens your tongue so that you must stop. Apprehensively, you look at the &rsquo;efreet, waiting for some reaction&mdash;and the &rsquo;efreet responds with delightful clapping. &ldquo;Mortal, I have not been entertained so in a long while. Please accept this gift.&rdquo; He vanishes, leaving a shiny object in front of you. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
