<p class="TaleDestiny">(2425) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You see a cloud of locusts scouring the plain like the plague called by the prophet Musa against the Pharaoh. You know that you cannot hope to live if they catch you, so you turn your horse and ride as hard as you can the other way. As you ride, you pray for protection from the Most High.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your horse proves too slow for the task, and the leaping insects begin to land on you. Luck is with you, however, and you and your horse tumble into a fast-running river. You do not know where you are when you finally return to the shore, but at least it is far from the locusts. [D+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
