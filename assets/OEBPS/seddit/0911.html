<p class="TaleDestiny">(911) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>While resting in the countryside, you overhear a conversation from a nearby grove. Curious, you creep closer and discover a beautiful maiden speaking with a dark serpent, her voice dull and lifeless. With a prayer to Allah on your lips, you step forward with your sword to hand. As the serpent&rsquo;s gaze meets yours, though, you feel your will slipping away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You turn and walk away, your body no longer at your own command. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Steeling your will against the magical blandishments of the serpent, you advance. Frightened, it slithers away, and the maiden breaks free of its evil spell.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are male and not Married</span>: Casting shame aside, the girl smothers you with kisses and clings tightly to you, and refuses to be parted from you save only by death. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: She produces from her robe a gem of great value. &ldquo;It is all I can give you, and only a fraction of what you deserve for your brave deed.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Princely)]</li>
