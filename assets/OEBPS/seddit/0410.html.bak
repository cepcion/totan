<p>You try to fool the other into rendering aid, rather than asking for it forthrightly. Thus you begin a tale of being his long-lost sibling.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other sees through your lies quickly, and denounces you to the Sultan as the shiftless sharper you are. The Sultan orders you imprisoned that you might learn the folly of wickedness. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
