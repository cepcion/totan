<p class="TaleDestiny">(1217) - ONE HUNDRED KEYS</p>
<p>You enjoy the hospitality of a beautiful merchant. Suddenly, your host arises with excuses and asks you not to stir from the main room. After your host is gone, an old serving maid brings you to a locked door.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;If you can open this, you will see a thing which will chill your heart.&rdquo; You cannot open it, and go back, puzzled. In the morning, you leave. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ONE HUNDRED KEYS</span>: You open it and peek in. Your host is conversing with a handsome man&mdash;and both have wings! You know that the bird-people become bound to land if they eat seed mixed with sand; you rush to the old woman and have her prepare a seed-cake with sand.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are not Married</span>: When you feed your host a bit of the cake, it strips away the magic of the bird-people. Chastened, your host agrees to accept Allah as the One True God and you as her spouse. You discover on your wedding bed that feathers have uses beyond flying. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are Married</span>: When she bites into the cake, she cries out, and you bind her to your will. In exchange for her freedom, she teaches you many of the mystic secrets of her people. [D+2 / S+2]</li>
