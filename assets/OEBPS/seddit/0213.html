<p class="TaleDestiny">(213) - APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Your scheme is completely successful but you realize that your profits could be enhanced with a ransom, so you take the other along. Unhappily, he has nothing of value on his person, and no one is interested in ransoming him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your captive eats like a horse and talks without pause. This goes on for many weeks, as you stubbornly look for someone to take this person off your hands. [D+1 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE, SEDUCTION</span>: Your captive is quite taken with you, and you discover to your amazement that he is most charming and delightful. The now meek-and-retiring character of your captive fills you with wonder. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span> (if appropriate and not Married)]</p>
