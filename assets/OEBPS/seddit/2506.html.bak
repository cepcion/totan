<p class="TaleDestiny">(2506) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>While traveling by ship, you hear a loud crash and the sounds of shouting on the deck. The owner of the vessel, a wealthy merchant, thrusts a scimitar into your hands as marauding pirates swarm over the sides of the ship.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fight as bravely as you can, but soon you and the merchant are overcome and thrown into the sea. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You are the whirlwind and lay about you with abandon. With you leading the counterattack, the crew drives the pirates from the ship. For the remainder of the journey, you are treated as a prince and given the run of the ship. [D+1 / S+1 / Seamanship]</p>
