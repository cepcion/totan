<p>Upon hearing the other&rsquo;s tale of unrequited love, you sense an opportunity: you assure the other of your ability to reunite lovers for a small fee. The other pays you and listens to your instructions: to wait outside a certain home at a certain time. What you didn&rsquo;t say was that it was the home of a powerful wizard; let the two battle of them it out. At your khan outside the city, you count your money while laughing at the prospect of what will happen when the two beings meet. Suddenly, your money melts away in your hands. It appears that someone else has gotten the last laugh. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
