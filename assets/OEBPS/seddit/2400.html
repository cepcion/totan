<p class="TaleDestiny">(2400) - None</p>
<p>A laughing crowd draws your curiosity. However, you can&rsquo;t make your way through the throng of people, so you decide to move along, certain you will hear all about it later. Sure enough, you do: it is an amusing tale of how the other, when trying to show off his power, stumbled on a stone and became trapped in a strange device. You are sure to tell this tale on your travels. [S+1]</p>
