<p class="TaleDestiny">(1988) - BEGUILING, SEDUCTION, COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You tried to cross the Valley of Dogs as quickly as you could so you would not encounter the ruthless beasts that live there. But you were so intent on the dogs, you walked right into a band of bandits who now block your path and demand your wealth!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: They are too many for you to resist. You pay them your gold, and they allow you to pass. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, SEDUCTION</span>: You convince the bandits that you don&rsquo;t carry any valuables worth stealing, and that you passed an overloaded merchant not far back on the trail. They rush past you towards the promise of even greater wealth. [D+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your high words and manners simply enrage the bandits. In addition to taking your money, they give you a sound beating. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
