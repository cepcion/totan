<p class="TaleDestiny">(818) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The other is far more skilled than you supposed. He toys with you, slashing your garments to shreds and tracing tiny wounds with his razor-sharp sword.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Finally you collapse. He kicks dust on you, spits, and leads the crowd as they hurl rotted fruits at you. You flee, but your shame follows you. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You collapse to the ground as if you had fainted. When the other draws near, you grab his leg, toppling him to the ground. The crowd cheers your cleverness as you make good your escape. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
