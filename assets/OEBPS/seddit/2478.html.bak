<p>You awake in the middle of the night to the sound of a small animal digging through your belongings. It appears to be a small cat, hungry and lost, with many minor injuries. You know little about animals, so you take the small creature to seek more knowledgeable help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You find a small cottage where an old woman keeps many such cats. She thanks you for helping save her lost kitten, and asks if there is any way she can reward you for your kindness. [S+1 / You may lose one status of your choice]</p>

To your amazement, her kiss is passionate and pleasant, and when you open your eyes, she is revealed to be a beautiful young maiden. &ldquo;Thank you for breaking the curse,&rdquo; she exclaims before leaping into your arms for another embrace.
