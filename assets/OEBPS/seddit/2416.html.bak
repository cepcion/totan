<p class="TaleDestiny">(2416) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, COURTLY GRACES, PIETY</p>
<p>A beautiful woman appears before you. &ldquo;Come, mortal, I need your aid in saving your people!&rdquo; Before you can draw another breath, you stand with the fiery beauty in the middle of an auditorium, filled with an audience of all manner of jinn. You are here to plead the case for the continued survival of human race!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your skills are not up to task at all and you don&rsquo;t know why you were chosen. But with the fate of all men in your hands, you blather your way to a stay in the destruction by 100 years. [D+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, COURTLY GRACES</span>: You weave words as skillfully as the greatest of Persia&rsquo;s artisans weave their tapestries. The audience is delighted, and the &rsquo;efreeteh announces their verdict: that the People of the Clay shall be allowed to live. &ldquo;I knew I had chosen wisely,&rdquo; whispers the &rsquo;efreeteh. With that, you find yourself back where you started, wondering out loud if you just had a waking dream. [D+3]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You know not what to say, so you kneel in prayer to Allah, begging for the human race to be spared. The gathered jinn nod approvingly and the &rsquo;efreeteh turns to you. &ldquo;You have shown us that faith is still strong among your kind, which proves that humanity is worthy of life.&rdquo; The jinn bow in respect&mdash;and you find yourself back where you started. [D+2 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
