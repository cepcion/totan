<p class="TaleDestiny">(2471) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>As you ride through fields choked with the remains of slain livestock, you are struck by the deathly silence of the place. The animals seem to have been drained of all blood by some terrible creature. You are right to worry about your own horses, as a great beast with leathery wings descends from the sky.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You have no choice but to flee. Sadly, your horse is too slow to flee the talons of the wyvern, and you find yourself on foot long before you reach the safety of the town. You are forced to purchase new supplies before you can continue your quest. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Raising a banner gifted to you by the local emir, you ride hard for the walls of the town. Seeing the banner and fearing for their prince, the guardsmen rush out to aid you and chase off the beast.
