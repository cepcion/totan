<p>There is so much treasure here that you could not possibly carry it on your own. You buy camels to carry the hoard back home.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You immediately use your newfound wealth to purchase a nice house and furnish it with much style. You eat the finest foods and throw magnificent parties for friends and family. You are blissfully unaware how quickly your treasure diminishes with your new extravagant lifestyle. [S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / On your next turn you do not move but you do have an encounter. After the encounter, you become Poor.)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You use your new-found wealth wisely, spending prudently and intelligently, and thus have enough money to live a life of comfort.
