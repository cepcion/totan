<p class="TaleDestiny">(1419) - LUCK</p>
<p>The other eyes you with disapproval, and you give him a wide berth.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You thank Allah that the other seems to have forgotten you quickly. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The other calls to you by name and you turn to face him. In his hands is a bag of gold. &ldquo;I believe you dropped this, did you not?&rdquo; You say that you did not, and the other is impressed with your honesty, and gives you a blessing before departing. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
