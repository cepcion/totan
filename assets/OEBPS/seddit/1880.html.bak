<p class="TaleDestiny">(1880) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>When someone is as miserable as you are, the last thing you want to see is some overly happy fool forcing his company upon you. In a fit of ire, you lash out at the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The severe beating you unleash upon the other has the desired effect. Now both of you are miserable. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: As soon as you begin beating the other about the head, you regret your decision to act so cruelly. This simple creature has done nothing to deserve your anger. Almost immediately, you change to kindness. The other is so grateful, he agrees to show you a secret!</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you have Stealth and Stealing</span>: The other leads you to a thieves&rsquo; den. While they sleep, you sneak in and claim their latest prize for yourself. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not</span>: The other shows you a den of thieves. You report them to the Vizier, who rewards you handsomely. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</li>
