<p class="TaleDestiny">(2444) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Traveling through the plains, you are amazed to hear a thunderous cracking sound. Approaching, you realize that an enormous roc is hatching from an egg the size of a palace! You know that the ravenous beast will surely eat all the livestock from the nearby village, so you draw your weapon and attack while it is vulnerable.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you are brave, and your arm mighty, you are no match for the terrible fury of the baby roc. Thank Allah it finds you too small a morsel and flies away without eating you. Alas, the locals blame you for the loss of their flocks. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: It is fortunate that you still carry the hunting spear given to you by your princely friend, for without a weapon that long, you could not hope to prevail against such an enormous being. Though the spear is shattered, you manage to pierce the monster&rsquo;s heart. [D+1 /
S+1 / Luck]</p>
