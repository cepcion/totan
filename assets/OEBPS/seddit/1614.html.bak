<p class="TaleDestiny">(1614) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You hire the other and all goes well for several weeks, despite persistent rumors which reach your ears of the other&rsquo;s indiscretions. One day an outraged citizen appears at your door and demands that your vassal be turned over for punishment for his crimes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The evidence is incontrovertible. You must turn your vassal over for punishment. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You have anticipated this moment, and have concocted an alibi both clever and well-told which will definitely prove your vassal&rsquo;s innocence. The outraged citizen is convinced, and leaves mollified. You chastise your vassal but are glad to retain him. [D+2 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
