<p class="TaleDestiny">(787) - MAGIC, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>As you speak, a menacing intelligence shines in the beast&rsquo;s eye. In the sand it clumsily writes, &ldquo;Give me a gift, and I will aid you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>:</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">If you have a treasure or wealth greater than Poor, you may choose to give it a gift</span>:</li>

<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you cannot</span>: You would give the miraculous beast a gift if you were not so destitute. It looks at you and gives a frighteningly human shrug as it walks away. [S+1]</li>
