<p class="TaleDestiny">(1270) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>A young pearl diver asks your help and promises to split his take fairly with you. Your sole duty is to warn the diver of danger.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You sit in the boat for hours, and the sun and the lapping of the waves put you to sleep. You awaken with a start and see a huge shark! You tug on the rope and pull it in. All you find is the severed end of the rope. What a horrid end for your partner! [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Although the job is dull, and sleep tugs at your eyes, you remain awake with the aid of Allah and the force of your will. In time, your partner returns with a handful of the finest pearls! [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
