<p class="TaleDestiny">(2483) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Accused of stealing, you are brought to a jail and tossed in a cell near another prisoner. To your amazement, the other turns out to be a former traveling companion. The other explains that the guards here often hold people on false charges, seeking to extract money from their kin. The two of you plot an escape: you will hurl objects at each other, and when the jailors intervene, you will seize the keys and break for freedom. The two of you face off, shouting and hurling loose stones and bricks.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The guards do not fall for your ruse. They simply gather to watch the show. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: The two of you clash mightily; your display is impressive and seems to shake the very walls of the jail. After a short time, the guards enter the cell to separate you and your former companion. At that moment, the two of you leap upon the guards, surprising and disarming them, and then make good your escape. When you are safe, your companion offers to teach you what he has learned since you last parted. [S+2 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
