<p class="TaleDestiny">(2408) - PIETY, INSANE  (M)</p>
<p>The ethereal beauty and haunting whispers of the &rsquo;efreeteh fill your head with promises of pleasure and power, and you beg to be with her.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The &rsquo;efreeteh has no interest in you and disappears in a rather dramatic fashion. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Your faith in Allah is too strong to believe the &rsquo;efreeteh: you know the promises the &rsquo;efreeteh presents are all false and come with a steep price. You hurl words of power and faith at the other; she screams, then shrinks into a point of light before disappearing with nary a sound. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">INSANE  (mandatory):</span> You feel your will slipping away. You become her slave, doing her bidding, fulfilling every whim, until the end of your days, which are longer than fated, extended by the power of your fiery master. [Death]</p>
