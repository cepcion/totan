<p class="TaleDestiny">(1364) - QUICK THINKING, BEAST FORM  (M)</p>
<p>The merman marvel that you have no tail. You are surrounded by curious onlookers when one merman shouts &ldquo;Dendan!&rdquo; You know that the cry of a true human can slay the dendan instantly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your fear causes your cry to stick in your throat. The merman scatter, and you are left alone beneath the waves. With much difficulty you make your way to a distant shore. [D+1 / S+1 / Move to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You cry out, and the dendan dies, saving the merman and yourself. [D+3 / S+3 / Storytelling / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEAST FORM  (mandatory):</span> You fly at the beast, shouting lustily at the top of your lungs. The dendan is not slain, but you are swallowed. As you die, you return to your true human form; human flesh is poisonous to the dendan, and it dies painfully. Many mermen witness the event, and tales are told to their children of the land-person who, though of surpassing ugliness, nobly sacrificed his life for those of the merfolk.
