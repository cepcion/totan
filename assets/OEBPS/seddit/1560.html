<p>You convince the jailor to come into your cell.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He does, and you overcome him easily. When he is unconscious, you make good your escape. [Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED, ENVIOUS  (All mandatory)</span>: He senses something fierce in your voice, and stands just outside your cell. You seize him, drag him up against the bars, and wring his neck. Unfortunately you find when you search his body that he had no key to your cell.
