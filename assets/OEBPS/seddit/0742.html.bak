<p class="TaleDestiny">(742) - COURTLY GRACES  (M)</p>
<p>You and the crew rush forward to view the giant black whirlpool below your ship.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shout at the top of your lungs, directing the crew to trim sails and shift course. Suddenly, the waters shoot up before you in a great fountain! To the surface floats a huge dendan, slain by the sound of the human voice, just as the legend says, and with its death the waters grow calm. You swim out to the dendan, and cut it open with a knife to claim some of the oil-laden blubber within. Before you can claim more than a handful, the body sinks beneath the waves. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1
(Max: Rich) / Dendan Oil]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES  (mandatory):</span> You give your orders in a calm, quiet voice, for you are far too refined to shout. Little do you realize that the swirl of waters is caused by the fierce actions of a dendan, who would have been slain by a shout. The whirlpool grows great beneath your boat and sucks it down into the depths. [D+1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / Move to any coastal space]</p>
