<p class="TaleDestiny">(1896) - STEALTH AND STEALING, SEDUCTION</p>
<p>What better accomplice than one who is already near death? With promises of a miraculous cure for the other&rsquo;s condition, you convince him to help you relieve a certain corrupt Vizier of a family heirloom.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other has little skill for such things, and the alarm is soon raised. When the guards are done with him, there is no one to testify against you. You escape unscathed. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You instruct the other carefully on what he should do, and he proves capable of following your directions. In exchange for a bottle of snake oil, he hands you the heirloom. [D+1 / Beguiling / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: The other is somewhat clumsy, so you need to provide a distraction. The guards are easily swayed by your attentions and the other completes the theft. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
