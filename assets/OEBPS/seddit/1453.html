<p class="TaleDestiny">(1453) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The other is sick at heart, and tells you, &ldquo;Despite the commandments of the Sultan of the Djinn, I have fallen in love with a mortal. I would do anything to be joined with her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are unable to think of a solution, and you pass on. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You disguise the other as a mortal, and escort him on foot to the abode of his love, where he enjoys a final night of bliss in her arms before returning to the Dusky Land. Because he used none of his own powers to approach his love, the Sultan of the Djinn remains forever unaware of his transgression. The other showers you with gifts for your help. [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / You may lose one status of your choice]</p>
