<p>Having heard rumors of a fabled Jeweled Fortress, you seek more information about the subject. You are directed to an old man perched on a high stool in a room filled with books. Looking up from his tome, he listens to your questions but slowly shakes his head. The information you seek will not come cheaply, and it is difficult for &ldquo;common&rdquo; people to understand.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may pay the scholar (as long as your Wealth is Poor or greater) and listen to his ramblings, or you may leave well enough alone:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you depart</span>: You hang your head in sorrow as you leave the scholar&rsquo;s home. You notice a trinket lying in the road, covered in mud. Fetching it, you rub vigorously and it turns out to be a plain golden ring. Today has not been completely wasted! [W+1 (Max: Poor)]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you pay</span>: The old man invites you back the next day. Upon your return, he launches into a lengthy and convoluted recital, referencing obscure passages and cryptic legends.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are quickly befuddled by the wizened one&rsquo;s exposition, as he intended. Convinced that your denseness is the cause of your puzzlement, you stagger from the house and drown your sorrows in a local tavern. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The old one takes far too long to get to any particular point, and he speaks quickly and with odd phrasing. You come to understand that he is trying to perplex more than elucidate. Still, there are nuggets of good information among the flotsam he spouts. You stoically follow his presentation, guiding him out of the channels of fraud into true knowledge whenever you can. After a number of hours, you feel you have gotten what you asked for, and far more than the codger intended. [D+1 / S+2 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / Opportunity to enter the <a href="0178.html#TaleHeader">Jeweled Fortress]</li>
