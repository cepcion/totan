<p class="TaleDestiny">(714) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>A great cloud like a column of silvery smoke rises from over the horizon. It thickens as you draw near.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll one die:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">4+: There stands before you an island in the middle of a large body of water. In the center of it there is a great rent in the earth from which a multitude of &rsquo;efreet rise in great turmoil and confusion. Suddenly one of the beings spies you and claps his hands with glee, pronouncing a spell in a strange tongue.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You feel as though you have been struck by lightning. When you look down, you have the form of a great ape. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> You are protected by your faith and your skill from the effects of the &rsquo;efreet&rsquo;s curse. As for him, a few words from you and he is blasted back to the Dusky Land. At another word, the waters of the lake rush forward and fill the hole in the earth. [D+2 / S+2]</li>
