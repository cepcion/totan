<p class="TaleDestiny">(1835) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>When you drank the cool, sweet water of the spring, you never imagined that it would change your gender! But truly there is no might and majesty save with Allah, for if you had not been thus altered, you would never have been able to assist your childhood friend. The cruel Vizier of this land who had imprisoned him would have recognized you immediately, but now you seem a completely different person!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though you cannot convince the Vizier to release your friend, your altered form does enable to you learn certain secrets of the court that would embarrass the Sultan if they should become known to the public. Thus blackmailed, the Sultan has no choice but to release your friend. You both quickly leave the kingdom before he changes his mind.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Though it raises bile in your throat, you realize that you are now in a perfect position to convince the Vizier to release your friend. You are careful to allow him nothing but promises, and you flee as soon as your friend is free. Best you never return to that kingdom.
