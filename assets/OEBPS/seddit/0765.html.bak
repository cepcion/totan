<p>The other eyes you as you pass, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to notice that you are trying to avoid him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize your fear of confrontation is not worthy of a child of Allah and you introduce yourself. The other is not impressed at your lack of social skills and makes the meeting brief. [S+1 / Lose Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other cannot stand idly by as someone as handsome as you walks by. The other calls out to you, but you continue on, unhearing. The other spits in your direction, cursing the lack of social skills in one so comely. [D-1 / Lose Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
