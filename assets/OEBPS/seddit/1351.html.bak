<p class="TaleDestiny">(1351) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A fish leaps from the lake. &ldquo;Seek my master in the city,&rdquo; it says. &ldquo;There you will find a young prince whose lower half is stone. His Queen betrayed him, and after he wounded her lover she laid a spell on the prince and turned we who were his people into fish.&rdquo; You go to where the wounded slave lies and slay him, taking his place. The queen returns.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fool her for only a short time before she sees through your ruse. As she proclaims a spell, you feel yourself change. [D+2 / S+2 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Feigning that your wounds have infected, you bid her lift her spells and use her powers instead to cure you. She reluctantly obeys. The instant the enchantment is lifted, your sword finds her throat; the prince and city dwellers honor you for your deeds. [D+3 / S+3 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
