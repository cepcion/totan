<p class="TaleDestiny">(548) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Your victim turns on you with righteous fury. &ldquo;How dare you presume to judge, you who know not the true state of affairs!&rdquo; You learn that the other is suffering from a gross miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You attempt to make amends for your error, but the soldiers of the wicked Vizier arrive and take the other away. You are tossed a bag containing thirty pieces of gold. [D-1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: Working quickly, you disguise him so the soldiers of the wicked Vizier do not recognize him. Thus you atone for your hasty actions. [D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom] </p>
