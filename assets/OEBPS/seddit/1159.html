<p class="TaleDestiny">(1159) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You bring a plan to the prince, calling for lions and tigers to be imported to the island. When all is prepared, the predators are to be let loose to battle the apes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Once this is done, indeed, the apes are no longer a problem. Now the lions and tigers are a problem. Your suggestion to import elephants is ignored, and you move on to solve other problems. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: At the last minute, you realize that just the sight and smell of the great cats will be enough to scare the apes. You have them set out in vast cages on the beaches. The plan works, and you are showered with honors. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
