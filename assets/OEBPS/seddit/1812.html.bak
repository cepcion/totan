<p class="TaleDestiny">(1812) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you cross the spine of a ridge, you see something shining in the sun. You approach to investigate and discover a broad pit filled with snakes. In the center stands a small pile of rocks, upon which sits a red stone statue of a serpent with rubies for eyes. So large are the rubies that they reflect the rays of the sun from over a league away!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You must have the statue for yourself! You run across the shallow pit, hoping to move fast enough to reach the stones unhurt. Without pausing, you grab the stone statue and continue running.</p>
<p>But your feet slip on the slithering forms beneath you, and you feel numerous little bites on your legs and ankles. By the time you reach the far side, the venom of many snakes course through your blood. Three days later you are found, nearly paralyzed, by the side of the road. You have no idea what fate befell the statue. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You remember that snakes are cold-blooded. If you wait until the coldest part of the night, they should be so sluggish that you can retrieve the statue without danger. Your wisdom proves true, and you easily retrieve the statue without disturbing the snakes. [D+1 / S+1 / Carnelian Idol]</p>
