<p class="TaleDestiny">(1330) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>You build ladders and enter the city. Inside are many statues, and a hideous ogre, who sits with his eyes closed. Suddenly he opens them, and one by one, all of your men are turned to stone.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You run screaming out of the city before you meet his terrible gaze. [D+2 / S+2 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Quicker than thought itself, you fire a single arrow into the ogre&rsquo;s eye. As he dies, the statues come back to life, and with them the city long dead. You are exalted and elevated for your heroism. [D+3 / S+3 / Weapon Use / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
