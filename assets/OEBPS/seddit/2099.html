<p class="TaleDestiny">(2099) - STEALTH AND STEALING, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>While traveling along an open road, you espy an old man, dressed in captain garbs, digging on the side of the road. Lying next to him are two fat purses. As you stare, he catches sight of you. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be thinking of stealing my treasure!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are too shocked to respond and quickly hurry away. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING, QUICK THINKING</span>: You tell him you wouldn&rsquo;t dream of it&mdash;that you were just making note of the place in which it was buried that you might make a map for him. The captain is grateful for your aid. When he is done, he takes your hastily drawn map and departs. You wait patiently, then dig up the treasure for yourself. [D+1 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
