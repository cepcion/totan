<p class="TaleDestiny">(1350) - SEDUCTION, APPEARANCE</p>
<p>The fish in the lake are red, white, yellow, and blue, the colors of the Magians, Muslims, Jews, and Christians of a typical city. The fish speak: they tell how their Queen was unfaithful to their King and turned their people to fish. From behind you, a voice cries out, &ldquo;And soon their fate shall be yours!&rdquo; It is the Queen!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your attack is futile; she gestures, and you feel yourself changing. You make good your escape while she laughs at your plight.
[D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION, APPEARANCE</span>: You flatter her fame and beauty&hellip; and slay her at first opportunity. As she dies, the fish become again the people of the city, who are most grateful for your aid! [D+3 / S+3 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling / Treasure]</p>
