<p class="TaleDestiny">(965) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>While strolling along, you hear voices approaching. Soon a great party of besotted brigands pass your hiding place, obviously on the way to a drunken revel. You tag along, wishing to join the fun.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Even as drunk as they are, the brigands notice you, pursue and capture you, and use you for sport. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You knock one of them unconscious and take his robes and burnoose. Thus disguised, you enjoy an evening of feasting at their expense. You learn much of the craft of thievery and a gain a few nice baubles, as well. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
