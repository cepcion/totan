<p class="TaleDestiny">(1740) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You realize that there may be many different groups of apes. Maybe you can turn them against each other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You search much of the island, but can find only one ape city. Their city is too well-guarded for you to approach it safely, so you return to the village. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: As you make your way towards the ape city, you are suddenly struck from behind! When you awake, you are brought before the ape king. Before he even speaks, you beg him for your life and offer him everything his heart desires. He spares your life in exchange for information about the villagers, who later curse your name as they are dragged into the ape city as slaves. But at least you aren&rsquo;t dead&hellip; [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
