<p class="TaleDestiny">(517) - MAGIC</p>
<p>The bizarre behavior of the other causes you to give him wide berth. Suddenly he cries out in an unearthly voice and charges you, fists waving.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After savagely battering you, he dashes past, howling like a beast. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You realize that the other suffers from an enchantment. You fetch an ewer of pure water, invoke powerful names over it, and sprinkle it upon the other. Straightaway, he comes to his senses and recalls that he is a merchant, ensorcelled by a wizard for his questionable trade practices. Grateful, he rewards you for your help. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
