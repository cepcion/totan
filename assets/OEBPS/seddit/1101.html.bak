<p class="TaleDestiny">(1101) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, ENVIOUS  (M)</p>
<p>You come upon a roc&rsquo;s nest filled with splendid gems. The roc guards the nest vigilantly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are daunted by the difficulty of the task. The treasure must go unexamined. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You reckon the risks against the gains and resolve to chance it. You dash for the nest and, as you had hoped, she cannot shift her tremendous bulk quickly enough to stop you. You make off with several gems. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Luck]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENVIOUS  (mandatory):</span> You are more than willing to risk the creature for the treasures you see, but your shaking hands are unable to manage it. You snatch a gem away as the Roc snaps at you and misses, but the second gem you grab is unexpectedly large. You hesitate, and the bird snaps off your head with a single clack. Your head remains aware throughout an interminable trip through the Roc&rsquo;s digestive system, and you perceive many rare and valuable gems in its crop before you finally go on to your reward. [Death]</p>
