<p class="TaleDestiny">(1837) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>During your wanderings, you come across a group of men hunting the mythical rhinoceros. You are intrigued by the tales you have heard of this strange animal and wish to join them on their hunt.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The men agree to let you accompany them after you offer to provide supplies for the journey. You are delighted when they find the animal&rsquo;s tracks a few days later. The creature proves to be exceptionally strong and dangerous, and it takes all of your skill and ability, along with that of your companions, to finally fell the mighty beast. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / Weapon Use]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: The men are impressed by your tales of hunting and exploration and decide that you would be a valuable addition to their expedition. But though you tell a convincing tale, your knowledge in the field proves to be far less than they anticipated. Though they come to mock you, their derision proves to be a valuable incentive to learn as much as you can in the field. [S+1 / Wilderness Lore / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
