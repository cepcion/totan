<p class="TaleDestiny">(1928) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You approach the town center just in time to see some ruffians toss the other into the fountain. To your astonishment, he floats just above the water, never getting wet!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is clearly ensorcelled. Lest he turn his ire upon you, best you give him a generous donation. A few coins ought to suffice.
[S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You help the other back onto dry land. He thanks you by telling you his tale. Cursed by the King of Atlantis, he can never touch water. You have heard tale of similar curses during your days at sea, and you know a way to lift it. [D+1 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
