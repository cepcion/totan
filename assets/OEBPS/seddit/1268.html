<p class="TaleDestiny">(1268) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You are over the pearl beds of Heragaya, watching the divers as they leap again and again into the waters. You notice one particular diver leap in with a beautiful dive; however, he does not come up for a very long time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Suspecting trouble, you dive down to rescue him. For some reason, he draws a dagger and tries to attack you! You swim away before he can harm you too greatly. (D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You ask another diver about the man. Laughing, he says, &ldquo;That one is blessed by Allah. He remains below three times as long as any of us.&rdquo; Great is the glory of the Most High! [D+1 / S+2]</p>
