<p class="TaleDestiny">(1026) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>You discover the sad woman to be a gooleh who wants to feed you to her children. You are determined to talk your way out of this trouble.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You beg for mercy, but her children have not eaten for days. She only wants a small piece of you! You faint in horror. You wake maimed, but alive. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Concealing that you know her identity, you say you have an enemy whom you fear. She is moved by your plea, and suggests, &ldquo;If you are a good Muslim, pray to Allah.&rdquo; Your prayers are eloquent, filled with remorse and the hope of God&rsquo;s mercy. The gooleh, in tears from your heartfelt prayers, renounces her evil nature and lets you leave.
[D+2 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
