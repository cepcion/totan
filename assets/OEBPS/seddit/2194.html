<p class="TaleDestiny">(2194) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, LUCK</p>
<p>Before you can even draw your blade, your foe is upon you!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are thrashed within inches of your life. The tale of your foolishness resounds through the lands unto seven generations. [D-1 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Blows rain upon you for a day and a night. As your foe finally takes a pause, he marvels at your ability to remain breathing. Satisfied that you have learned your lesson, the other leaves you to lick your many, many wounds. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The first blow of your foe sends you flying into the wet embrace of a rushing river that swiftly carries you away. Half-conscious, you feebly struggle against the currents, being battered against rocks and tree limbs. Finally an errant branch catches your sleeve and deposits you onto the bank. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
