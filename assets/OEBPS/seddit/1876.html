<p class="TaleDestiny">(1876) - SEDUCTION, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>The man you hired for this job proves to be out of his mind. At the worst possible moment, the insanity of the other overcomes him, and he begins shouting and waving his arms.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other draws the attention of the Vizier&rsquo;s guards, who promptly throw him into a cell. They throw you in too, just for being near the mad one. [<span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: The other&rsquo;s insane shouting leads the Vizier&rsquo;s men to arrest you both. You are dragged before him for questioning. You have heard disturbing stories of the unusual tastes of the corrupt Vizier, and with seductive words you convince him that the other is the perfect outlet for those tastes. For your aid, the Vizier releases you. [S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You imitate the other so exactly that the guards believe you are both mad. Rather than risk their own minds, they deposit you outside the town walls with orders never to be seen here again. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span> / Move one space in any direction]</p>
