<p class="TaleDestiny">(264) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other is crazed and obviously obsessed with you. You find the other pitiful in some ways, and repulsive in others. The other has tried a disguise to trick you. Thinking the other might have evil intentions, you try to avoid him. You are unable to avoid the other and he traps you in a conversation.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Speaking to the other, you learn of his bitter and cruel heart, but (fortunately) his vengeance does not touch on your affairs. He was wronged by a woman, and as a result hates all women. You fear his bitter hatred and avoid further contact with him. [Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Although you would prefer to avoid contact with this bitter person, you never let anything stand in the way of business. You consider yourself fortunate to avoid his wrath, and depart as soon as you have concluded your dealings. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Luck]</p>
