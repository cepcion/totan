<p>One evening, you enjoy the hospitality of a rich host. When he must leave for a while, he wishes you to stay and await him. &ldquo;You may amuse yourself in my rooms,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t open the one-hundredth door.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You obey the wishes of your host. That night you are awakened by a hand over your mouth. You see the turban of the Magian fire-worshipper! You manage to escape their evil rituals but not before you are severely injured. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You cannot resist temptation, and open the one-hundredth door. Within are your host and his spouse, and a great meeting of evil Magian fire-worshippers! Taking them by surprise, you easily slay them all, an act most pleasing to the Most High! [D+2 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
