<p>The other, hearing of your exploits, wishes to join you on your adventures. He follows you everywhere, disrupting your business, and finally you have had enough.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cuff him across the face, sending him sprawling to the ground. Those around you jeer your violence towards this wretch. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You deftly cut his robes with your scimitar. &ldquo;When you learn to master a sword like this, then you may join me!&rdquo; The other bows graciously, happy for a purpose in life. [D+1]</p>
