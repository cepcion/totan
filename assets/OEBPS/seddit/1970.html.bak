<p>What you first believed to be a massive warfleet, on closer inspection reveals itself to be a convoy of merchant ships. Clearly, they are from foreign parts, for if they knew this area as well as you, they would never risk such heavy ships on the shifting sandbars and reefs that you have learned so well.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You approach the merchantmen to warn them of the dangers ahead, but they spurn your offer. Rarely is such sinful pride rewarded so directly. Shortly after you depart, the lead vessel losses its bottom on an unseen reef. Thus does Allah humble the haughty! [S+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You realize that foreign merchants will not trust you, fearing that you might lead them into a trap for pirates. But you are unwilling to abandon them to their fate. By pretending to run aground on a sandbar, you are able to coax the foreigners into deeper water and the safety of the main channel. Though they will never know of their debt to you, you know that the All-Merciful always rewards the generous.</p>
