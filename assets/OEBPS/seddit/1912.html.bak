<p>You recognize the other as one who wronged you previously. You determine to extract your full revenge.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Without significant preparations, you attack the other, leaving him dead on the cobblestones. But your brazen attack did not go unnoticed, and soon his relatives drag you before the Sultan. As punishment, you are ordered to serve the other&rsquo;s family until his debts are paid. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You remember that the other belongs to a powerful family in these parts. Fortunately, a sea captain you aided some time back has recently arrived in port and agrees to help you escape the family&rsquo;s wrath. Immediately before the ship sails, you slay the villain and make good your escape by sea. [D+1 / S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> (Prince)]</p>
