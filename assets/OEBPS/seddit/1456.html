<p>The other glares in response to your words. &ldquo;You seek only to gain profit at my expense, do you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other will have no dealings with you; your conversation is seen by many, and your shame is great. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING  (mandatory):</span> Your confidence in your wit and tongue lead you to attempt to trick the other, when it is obvious that he is skeptical of your character. You persist long after sense would have dictated you withdraw, and he publicly humiliates you for your false dealing. [D+1 / Lose Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
