<p class="TaleDestiny">(962) - WEAPON USE  (M), COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>Some distance off you spy a small party of raucous men drinking and carousing. They fit the descriptions of brigands operating in the area.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Despite the fact that they are not harming anyone, you attack them boldly. Drunken and surprised, they fall easy prey. Unfortunately, they were innocent men, and you are punished for your folly. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You recognize many signs of noble breeding in the demeanor of these men, and cautiously observe them further. Then you get a look at one&rsquo;s face&mdash;it is a young friend of the prince! How fortunate you did not act in haste, for haste is the enemy of prudence.
