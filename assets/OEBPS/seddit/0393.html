<p class="TaleDestiny">(393) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says the other, sweetly.&rdquo; I would be happy to do business with you. Come with me and we will talk business together.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do so. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;let me give you&mdash;this!&rdquo; You hear a loud *poof*, and suddenly your mind is no longer completely your own. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You are immediately suspicious of the other. Anticipating a betrayal, you seize an obviously enchanted item from the other before he can do you harm. The other refuses to cooperate with you, so you keep the item in recompense. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Treasure]</p>
