<p class="TaleDestiny">(2443) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>A horrific creature, with long gangly arms and a twisted visage, attacked your camp. Curiously, it did not harm you or steal anything of value. Only a few mundane cooking utensils are found to be missing. You wonder what strange creature would steal pots but not the food next to it. Intrigued, you track the beast to a ruined tower. It should be easy to trap it inside.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you try to block the entrance, the creature panics and attacks you! Unable to defend yourself, you are soon knocked unconscious. You awaken later with a terrible headache; the creature is nowhere to be seen. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You realize that the ruins are the tower of a great wizard. You have heard tales of his experiments gone terribly wrong. If you can trap him, perhaps you can force him to reveal his secrets!</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you have Beguiling</span>: You trick the former wizard into attacking you by blocking the entrance to the tower. He he does not suspect that a hidden net is waiting for him outside. Once snared, he is eager to trade his knowledge for his freedom. [D+1 / Magic]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If not</span>: The former wizard is easily tricked into your net, but you discover that he has more than talons to protect his secrets when he casts a terrible curse on you! [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</li>
