<p class="TaleDestiny">(1146) - WEALTH: POOR or less (M), WEALTH: PRINCELY or greater (M), ONE HUNDRED KEYS</p>
<p>In the side of a hill, you discover a jeweled trapdoor. Cautiously you enter, and see within is a fabulous treasure! You greedily pick up the treasure, and the door slams shut. Surprised, you drop your spoils&mdash;and the door opens. It seems you may gaze at the treasure but cannot steal it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEALTH: POOR or less (mandatory):</span> Your greed holds you prisoner. You do not leave until almost dead with hunger, and still you cannot remove the thoughts of the gold from your mind. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEALTH: PRINCELY or greater (mandatory)</span>: Treasure isn&rsquo;t worth starving over. You leave behind the treasure and walk out safely. [D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ONE HUNDRED KEYS</span>: You think of your keys and wonder&hellip; Taking them out you try one of the keys. It works! You dash out with your loot.
[W+3 (Max: Princely)]</p>
