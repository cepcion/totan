<p class="TaleDestiny">(2467) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, you realize the &ldquo;creature&rdquo; was&mdash;is&mdash;a man! An affliction this horrible needs your help and protection. You offer to see if the other&rsquo;s condition can be attended to by physicians.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other says that many have tried and failed. The more you talk to the other the more you see of his condition. You recognize the boils from your travels. He is truly lost. You suggest a pilgrimage to Mecca to make his peace with Allah, and you offer to join him to make sure that he gets there. He is most grateful and sings your praises to one and all. [D+2 / Piety / Wilderness Lore / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You know the other to be wrong in his dismal thoughts. You have had his exact condition! It was very painful but you know a remedy&mdash;equally painful but unfailingly effective. [D+2 / Scholarship / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
