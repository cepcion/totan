<p class="TaleDestiny">(2474) - SEDUCTION (if you are female), BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You were searching some ruins for a cache of precious gems, only to find them guarded by a dangerous and powerful serpent-like creature! You remember seeing a snake charmer in a small village a few days back. Perhaps you can convince him to share the secrets of his craft so you can avoid the terrible beast.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The snake charmer tells you that his secrets can only be shared with members of his religious sect. You realize that he is part of a Magian cult! You report him to the Vizier, who rewards you for your diligence. Sadly, it is worth much less than the gems you hoped to recover. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION (if you are female)</span>: You use all of your charms and wiles to convince the captain to share the rewards with you. So swayed is he by your seductive ways that he is woefully ill-prepared when you tell the Sultan the truth of his greedy betrayal. The Sultan has him cast in irons and appoints you to the now-vacant position. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: The man refuses to share his secrets, but in exchange for a promise of half the gems, he agrees to help you. The snake creature is enthralled by his rhythmic music and movements, and you easily collect the prize. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
