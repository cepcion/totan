<p>As soon as the other looks you in the eye, you draw your weapon and attack. You don&rsquo;t even know why.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are promptly arrested for murder and sentenced to hang. As you are lead to the gallows, you see the other in the crowd, grinning an evil grin! You see now that he is a magician, and has plotted to destroy you. But Allah does not allow such evils to pass, and the rope breaks when you are hanged. You choke out that this occurrence is proof of your innocence. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You remember learning how to deal with dangerous cobra snakes. They also have mesmeric powers like the other is using on you. Like the cobra, the only way to be sure is to strike off his head. As soon as you relieve the other of his skull, his spell on the local populace is broken. When he realizes what you have saved him from, the Sultan selects you to be his trusted advisor. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
