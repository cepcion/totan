<p class="TaleDestiny">(287) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>The other is lost and at his wits&rsquo; end. So eager is he to be on his way, you are hardly able to make him remain and listen to your directions.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A few hours later, you meet him again, still lost. &ldquo;You scoundrel,&rdquo; he roars. &ldquo;You did this deliberately!&rdquo; Then he proceeds to thrash you soundly with his cudgel, and you count yourself fortunate to escape with only minor wounds. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You calm the other and patiently explain the directions; as a safeguard you offer to accompany him as a guide. You are richly rewarded for your efforts and make a valuable business contact. [D+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
