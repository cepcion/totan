<p class="TaleDestiny">(1029) - APPEARANCE, PIETY, BEAST FORM  (M)</p>
<p>The other sits weeping by the side of the road. You ask why she weeps. &ldquo;I have just sworn to the True Faith, but I am a gool. All my life, I have eaten human flesh. Allah, in His Wisdom, forbids such things. What can I do?&rdquo; You sit with her and puzzle the tests which Allah places before His faithful.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, APPEARANCE</span>: As you ponder, the gooleh is overcome with hunger and takes a chunk out of you. Howling, you flee, her remorseful cries barely audible over her smacking lips. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You pray with her for a solution. Suddenly, a deer stumbles into the clearing and drops dead. To her surprise, the gooleh likes deer flesh more than human! [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEAST FORM  (mandatory):</span> Abruptly, the details of your changed form penetrate her dim mind. &ldquo;Why, you are no man, but a talking beast,&rdquo; she exclaims with delight, tearing off one of your limbs to sample. What she says next is difficult to understand because her mouth is full, but as she swallows she begins to cry, &ldquo;Allah be praised, your flesh is every bit as tasty as a man&rsquo;s, yet surely Allah does not forbid the eating of a creature such as you!&rdquo; You perish, knowing at least that you have been the instrument of Allah&rsquo;s will. [Death]</p>
