<p class="TaleDestiny">(2138) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Grateful for your kindness, a sage tells you an old family story. He describes an ancient ruined city paved in gold far off in the wilderness. Although many have wondered about this city, his ancestors actually visited it. Since then, the family has recited an intricate poem detailing the path to this city. The words have not been entirely preserved over the years, however, and none can decipher the landmarks mentioned or the route indicated. It is sad that such wealth is lost.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You thank the old man for his story, but can make no sense of the poem he recites. Truly the gold is lost to the ages. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You work carefully through the poem with the sage, weighing the words and phrases against your intimate knowledge of the wilderness. In time, you discover subtle clues that you recognize. Much more study is needed, but you have opened the old man&rsquo;s eyes to certain possibilities. He is exceedingly grateful and rewards you by conveying some of his extensive knowledge. [D+2 / S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
