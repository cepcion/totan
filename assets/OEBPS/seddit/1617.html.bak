<p>Suspicious of the armed status of the other, you carefully watch to see what deeds are being carried out. You see that the other is a thief and has amassed quite a stash of loot. You decide to wait for the other in the forest and ambush the fiend to teach a lesson&mdash;and gain some treasure.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is fast with the sword and skilled in the woods. There is no winning the fight and no pursuing when the other escapes.
[S+1 / Wilderness Lore]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You get to know the forest and prepare for a proper ambush. The stage is set for success, and you strike at just the right moment&mdash;the other not suspecting a thing. Among his goods you find a most remarkable item. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
