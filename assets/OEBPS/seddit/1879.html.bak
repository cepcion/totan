<p>The simple-minded other insists on following you everywhere you go. It&rsquo;s beginning to interfere with your plans! You&rsquo;re going to have to frighten him off before everything is ruined.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cuff the other soundly upon the head. He whimpers and looks at you with tears welling in his eyes. Your heart melts with regret for your callous action, but painful choices must be made. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP, ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Your years at sea have taught you the importance of discipline, and the hardest duty of all is correcting an errant crewman. As humanely as you can, you beat the wretch, but only enough to send him on his way. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
