<p>The other smiles at you, and you stand transfixed. You are barely able to choke out a prayer to Allah, but He hears you and allows you to draw your weapon. The other laughs and slowly fades into nothingness, a mere illusion.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: At the next town you enter you tell your tale, but the townsfolk laugh at you with incredulity: you cannot even buy water here, let alone get help on your quest. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
