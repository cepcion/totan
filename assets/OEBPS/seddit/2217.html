<p class="TaleDestiny">(2217) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Despite all common sense, lust for the other&rsquo;s wealth compels you to rob him. Half-crazed by greed, you assault the other, grasping for what you hope will be treasures.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Enraged, the other buffets you with a mighty blow of his chains, clashing from your head what little sense you had left. When you come to, you are no longer sure where you are&hellip; or even who. [<span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You awake sometime after the other cuffs you into a daze. The number of days you have lain on the side of the road refuses to come to you. You wander the land until your senses return. [<span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
