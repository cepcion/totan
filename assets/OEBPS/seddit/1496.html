<p class="TaleDestiny">(1496) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Sometimes greed is the better part of valor. Disregarding the other&rsquo;s wretched condition, you steel your heart and demand what coin they may have.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With tears in his eyes, but resigned to his poor fate, the other hands you the last of his money. &ldquo;I may be poorer than the dirt under Allah&rsquo;s feet, but you plainly are more troubled than I.&rdquo; The coins do not last nearly as long as the other&rsquo;s words. [D-2 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: With ease you remove the other&rsquo;s purse and are gone before your victim takes note. The sad few coins in the purse do not even provide a single meal. The plight of the other cuts you deep. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
