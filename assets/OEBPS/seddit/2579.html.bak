<p class="TaleDestiny">(2579) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>News of the arrest of the other&mdash;your cousin&mdash;disturbs you greatly&mdash;he is accused of murdering a passing dervish. You return home as fast as your camel will carry you. When you arrive, you find your cousin beyond comprehension, gibbering about sorcerers, &rsquo;efreet in human skin, and the curse of a thousand buried treasures. You recall a local mad one who has the reputation for speaking in tongues. You attend the other and offer fair payment to speak to your cousin. The words that pass between the two make no sense to you. Still, when they are done the mad one tells you that your cousin murdered an evil sorcerer and that he has been ensorcelled.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You explain the story to the magistrate, but he is unmoved. Only a significant bribe will return your cousin to his family. [S+1 / W-1
(Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Armed with this tale, you plead your cousin&rsquo;s case to the local magistrate. Through hard bargaining and reasoned argument, you are able to convince the official your cousin did no wrong. The magistrate brings in a magician who frees your cousin of his affliction.
