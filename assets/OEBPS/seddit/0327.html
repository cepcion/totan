<p class="TaleDestiny">(327) - LUCK, APPEARANCE  (M)</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It avails you nothing of course: your fate is no less your fate.
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, APPEARANCE  (mandatory):</span> You successfully avoid hearing the pronouncement&mdash;in which you were mistakenly revealed as the only child of the recently deceased Sultan. Thus does every person suffer who seeks to avoid his fate. [D+2]</p>
