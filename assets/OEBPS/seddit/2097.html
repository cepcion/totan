<p class="TaleDestiny">(2097) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The Six-Pointed Star of Wonder is a jewel which is rumored to drive its owner mad. You disbelieve the legend until one day you find a rough sea-captain wearing the very Star&mdash;and wearing also the clear signs of madness. Because of his affliction, he is an easy mark and you make off with the gem from under his very eyes.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Although all the signs were there in front of you, you somehow thought that you would escape the curse of the Star. Sadly, no.</p>
<p>The taint remains even after you have resold the gem. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: The selfsame stories which lead you to seek the gem also told you of the proper rituals, prayers, and deeds to remove the curse. Not only do you avoid madness, you free all those who have suffered the curse from bearing the gem; they sing your praises. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
