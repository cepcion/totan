<p class="TaleDestiny">(909) - GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You happen to tread on the tail of a mangy cur. You expect it to bark, but are startled as it curses you in blasphemous epithets. A talking dog&mdash;and an infidel at that! Laughing at your surprise, the dog clashes between your legs, shouting imprecations and profaning the name of the Prophet!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Infuriated, you chase it wildly, clashing headlong into a stone wall. You lie there, dazed, the dog&rsquo;s profane utterances receding in the distance. Finally, you rise to go on your way. What wonders Allah has created! [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: Righteously angry, you give chase to the blasphemous cur, Allah in His wisdom guiding your footsteps. The beast darts every which way, but cannot escape you. Finally it darts into the path of a heavily laden cart, and is crushed. Thus is the justice of the Most High revealed! [D+1 / S+2 / Piety]</p>
