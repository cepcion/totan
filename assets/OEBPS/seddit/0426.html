<p class="TaleDestiny">(426) - DETERMINED (M), WEAPON USE, ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Casting aside his robes, the other brandishes a wicked sword. &ldquo;Come, fool!&rdquo; he cries. &ldquo;This is the fate you have chosen&mdash;do not shy away from it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is an expert swordsman and cuts you to ribbons, leaving you for dead. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED (mandatory), WEAPON USE, ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Clearly, he is your superior, and you observe many clever tricks with the sword as he cuts you in a hundred places. However, your determination keeps you standing even though your blood flows like a mighty river. In respect for your courage, he spares your life and tends to your wounds.
