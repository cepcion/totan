<p class="TaleDestiny">(2572) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You happen upon a young other beside a lonely oasis. Offering the other a gold coin for his services, you ask that he guide you to the nearest village. He agrees and leads you off into the desert. Hours pass, and your young guide walks and walks. Finally, you can take no more and you ask, &ldquo;How much longer to the village, my friend?&rdquo; The other turns and flashes a wry grin. &ldquo;Village?&rdquo; The rogue explains that he has taken you into the Desert of Death. He might be able to guide you back out again, but it will cost much more than a couple coins.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: With little recourse, you agree. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You shake your head &ldquo;I believe I can retrace our steps. You&rsquo;ll get no satisfaction from me.&rdquo; When you finally arrive at a settlement, you inform the local magistrate of the man&rsquo;s trickery, and he promises to warn local travelers of the fraud.
