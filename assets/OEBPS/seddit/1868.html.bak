<p class="TaleDestiny">(1868) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Heedless of the warnings you were given, you strike the other a mighty blow with your truncheon.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other glares angrily into your eyes. In a moment you drop your club and stand motionless. Despite your desire, your feet take on a mind of their own! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: The other has some kind of hypnotic control over the crowd! As soon as you lay hands on him, they turn on you as if in a trance. Against such hopeless odds, you are forced to plead for your life. The other agrees to accept a service in exchange for sparing you. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
