<p class="TaleDestiny">(2259) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR, FATED (M), ENDURING HARDSHIP (M)</p>
<p>The alleyway you are strolling through suddenly becomes dark. Then a great gout of flame strikes in front of you; within, you see a human figure. You bow down, pleading for your life to be spared. &ldquo;Please help me,&rdquo; moans the figure within.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: There is nothing you can do: so soon as the flames appeared, now they disappear and light once again enters the alleyway. But your heart remains darkened, heavy with sorrow for the poor trapped soul.
[S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: Instinctively, you thrust the artifact into the flame and with a great whoosh of air the flame blows out, taking your treasure with it. Standing there is the other, who brings you to his estate and rewards you generously. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely / Treasure / Lose choice of Protective Talisman or Sparkling Spear]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">FATED, ENDURING HARDSHIP  (All mandatory)</span>: Your immediate reaction is to jump into the flame to offer more assistance. Then, a concussive noise causes you to lose consciousness. When you awaken, you are alone and no longer in the land of Men. [D+2 / Move to the <a href="0182.html#TaleHeader">Dusky Land</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
