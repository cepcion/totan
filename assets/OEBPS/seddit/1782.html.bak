<p class="TaleDestiny">(1782) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You find yourself in the mysterious Palace of 100 Closets. Your kind host has invited you to explore his home, and you are amazed at the wonders you encounter: But you find the hundredth door locked and cannot enter. You grow curious about what is hidden there, and you try to convince your host that no harm will come from allowing you just one little peek.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your host insists that some treasures are far too dangerous, and that they must be shielded from the eyes of all mortals. Despite offers, cajolery, and threats, your request is flatly denied. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Even the most resistant can be swayed when the right offer is made. Using all of your charms and wiles, you convince your host to allow you to pass the hundredth portal. To your wonder and amazement, beyond that last door is not another room, but a passageway to a far distant place. [D+1 / Move to the <a href="0178.html#TaleHeader">Jeweled Fortress</a> and have an immediate encounter]</p>
