<p class="TaleDestiny">(1715) - LUCK</p>
<p>So beautiful is the outside of the palace made of glass that you can only wonder at what marvels lie hidden within. But alas, the guards are many and watchful, and you cannot come even close to the palace walls. Dismayed, you sit and whisper a prayer to the All-Merciful.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You notice the shadow of the palace on the ground, and the curiously filtered light of the late afternoon sun reveals something unusual about the palace. You realize it has a hidden entrance! Moving cautiously, you are able to slip into the palace unobserved. You will always remember the fabulous sights within! [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: During your prayers, you notice an opportunity while the guard is changed. As the guards are focused on ceremony, you seize the opportunity to creep unnoticed into the barracks. Once inside, you quickly don a uniform. You blend in with the guards so perfectly, no one questions you and you spend many joyous hours wandering the halls of the palace. [D+1 / S+2 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
