<p class="TaleDestiny">(1979) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Heedless of the danger, you climb to the edge of the volcanic caldera and are surprised to discover a band of men in red turbans. You had heard that vile Magians sacrifice their innocent victims in volcanoes just like this one, and this proves it!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Before you can approach close enough to stop them, they hurl their victim into the flames. Most of the Magians escape your wrath, but at least a few loin their sacrifice in the fires below. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You are fortunate enough to find some Magian robes discarded by the side of the path. Donning them quickly, you call to your &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; to wait for you. When you are in their midst, it is easy to catch them by surprise and make them the sacrifice for the volcanic flames! [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
