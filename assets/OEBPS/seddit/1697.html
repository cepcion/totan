<p class="TaleDestiny">(1697) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are assisting a friend who is hiring helpers for an elephant hunt when, among the workers, you spy an old rival&mdash;one who stole the heart of your beloved. You swore you would get your revenge. You curtail your haggling over his wages before he can recognize you and set him up as the leader of the expedition.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the band attempts to capture the elephant, you get your revenge. Hunting elephants is dangerous, and no one would suspect that you pushed him on purpose. Now if only your guilt could be so easily discarded. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You send off the hunters and then don the most magnificent robes you own and fashion a high turban with a magnificent fake gem. Satisfied that you look officious, you wait for your rival to return from the field. Presenting yourself as a Vizier of the local Sultan, you accuse him in the public square of poaching! To your delight, the local magistrate believes you, and your foe is imprisoned. You are rewarded with half the ivory he has &ldquo;stolen.&rdquo; [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Beguiling]</p>
