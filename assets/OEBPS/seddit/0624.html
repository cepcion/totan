<p class="TaleDestiny">(624) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Your cries for help attract a curious beast which attacks you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A second cry brings a feral child who robs you. A third (less confident) cry brings a malevolent ogre who kicks you and chuckles as you fall screaming to the ground. When you do not get up again, he departs, disappointed that you have not provided him with more entertainment. Still, you decide to cry out again for what further woes can you suffer? A passing merchant finds you and takes you to civilization where he wishes you better fortune. [D+1 / S+2 / W-1 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You wisely fall silent and hide yourself after this unfortunate encounter, and you avoid several other unfriendly marauders. [D+2 / S+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
