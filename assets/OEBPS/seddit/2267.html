<p class="TaleDestiny">(2267) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>A traveling prince has come into the town you are visiting, demanding to be treated according to his stature. The townspeople oblige but something about the prince strikes you as odd. The other is obviously disguised, and you seek to reveal his charade before anyone is harmed.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Questioning him over dinner leads nowhere; but while you eat, you notice that he never does anything without watching the others first. He does not know proper table etiquette! You conspire to have him be the first to sample the monkey brains when they are brought to the table. When he begins to eat before the host is served, the murmurs trigger a cascade of discoveries. [S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: The more you speak with the other, the more it is clear that he is only a servant of some sort. By a clever line of questioning, you easily reveal him to be a charlatan. The townspeople deal with him swiftly for his ruse. [D+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
