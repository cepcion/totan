<p class="TaleDestiny">(1376) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>You summon a small &rsquo;efreet to do your bidding. You instruct him to scout over the top of the hill. He disappears and is gone for a long time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Impatient, you creep to the top of the hill. There you see a huge evil-looking &rsquo;efreet holding your servant captive. When he sees you, the evil one blasts you with a magic bolt. Pain overwhelms you, and the next thing you know, you are standing in the world of men. [D+2 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You wait all night and all the next day. Finally your servant returns. &ldquo;Yonder was a mighty council,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Many were the debates that were fought and the tales that were told.&rdquo; He tells you all that he learned, and you record the secrets close to your heart. [D+3 / S+3 / Magic / Protective Talisman]</p>
