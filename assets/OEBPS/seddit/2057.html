<p class="TaleDestiny">(2057) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>While traveling at night, you gain the crest of a hill and discover a brigand camp in the valley below. Most of the gang is asleep, leaving only two guards quietly tending a fire.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the time is right, you throw a stone to get one of the guards to move away from the camp. You then move in on the other one and knock him senseless before he can raise the alarm. Trying to take more loot than you can carry causes the first guard to return before you&rsquo;ve made good your escape, and he rouses the entire gang to action. You manage to get away, but now they&rsquo;re out for blood! [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>] </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: At the edge of the camp you spy what looks like a barrel&hellip; It is lamp oil! Your mind racing, you circle around to the far side of the valley and sneak up to the camp&rsquo;s perimeter. With a long branch you tip the barrel over, right into the fire! The resulting conflagration sets the camp ablaze, and in the chaos you escape with the loot. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
