<p class="TaleDestiny">(1843) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>A rampaging rhino has trapped you in the branches of a large tree. After nearly an hour clinging to a branch, you see some travelers in the distance. Desperately you wave at them for help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The travelers are frightened by the size of the creature at the base of the tree. They quickly head the other direction, leaving you to your fate. You spend the next night and day in the shelter of the tree until the animal finally leaves you in peace. [S+1 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You can see that the travelers are intimidated by the beast. You realize that you need to promise them something valuable if you are going to convince them to help you. Sadly, you left your valuables in town when you went out to seek the rhino. Perhaps you can think of something else that might interest them&hellip; [S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
