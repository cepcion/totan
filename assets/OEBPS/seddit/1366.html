<p class="TaleDestiny">(1366) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You marvel at the majesty of even the smallest of the undersea kings, and seek to learn all you can of these people. Soon, you come to understand that the undersea kings are planning to invade the cities of the air-dwellers&mdash;your own people!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The mermen suspect from your actions that you have learned the truth, and feed you the poisonous flesh of the Shira fish, which erases your memories of their plots. You return to the surface none the wiser. [D+2 / S+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You conceal what you have learned from your hosts, but soon ask to be returned to the land. There you warn the Sultan, who sends peace emissaries to the mermen. With you as an intermediary, a lasting peace is reached, and you are much praised. [D+3 /
S+3 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</p>
