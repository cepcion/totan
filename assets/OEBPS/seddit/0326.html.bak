<p class="TaleDestiny">(326) - BEGUILING, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>A crowd has gathered to listen to the other, who has promised to explain the cause of the hard economic times. His doubletalk has gone on for hours, and the crowd grows restless. You are made uneasy by his words, and head in another direction. As you make to leave, he points at you and cries, &ldquo;Look there! There is the one who is the cause of all your troubles! Shall this one go unpunished?&rdquo; The air is filled with angry snarls.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The crowd moves toward you, and your protestations of innocence go unheard. Then they are upon you, and treat you savagely
[D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, QUICK THINKING</span>: &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; you cry in a booming voice. &ldquo;Will you deny me the right to defend myself?&rdquo; The crowd pauses and you leap to take advantage. Speaking with inspiration and surpassing yourself with fine oratory, you turn and accuse your accuser. The mob visits its wrath on him instead of you. [D+1 / S+2 / Choice of Courtly Graces or Acting and Disguise]</p>
