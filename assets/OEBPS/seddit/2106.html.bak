<p>Surely a Magnetic Mountain would make a fine place to hide from the soldiers of the Sultan. After all, they could not bring their weapons close enough to attack you!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Even without weapons, a hundred men can easily overpower you. Now you will have to explain how you came to be in the secret garden with his daughter (or son)&hellip; [S+1 / Seduction / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span> (if you are not Married) Imprisoned (if you are Married)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Somehow, the Sultan and his men do not know of the magic in this mountain. You stand between them and the cliff, warning them that you will use your mighty magic against them if they do not leave you be. When they approach, you wave your hands and grin as their weapons are pulled from their hands to fly towards the cliff wall behind you! In a panic, the soldiers turn and run, leaving the Sultan alone. He promises a terrible fate if you ever come near his daughter (or son) again before turning on his heel to depart. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
