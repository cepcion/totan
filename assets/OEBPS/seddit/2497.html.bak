<p>As you sit comfortably in the shade of a large palm, a young other joins you. The other is so forlorn, you cannot help but ask what ails him. After a tentative pause, a tale comes gushing forth. The story involves long, tedious descriptions, vague and uninteresting characters in vague and uninteresting situations, and seemingly very little point. Unwilling to drive the person away, you continue to listen, offering only small comments here and there.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your mind drifts off. In the fullness of time, the other comes to a conclusion and stands up. &ldquo;Thank you, stranger, for listening to my tale. It was good to get it off my chest.&rdquo; You nod numbly as the other walks off. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: After a time, you realize the other simply needs someone to listen to them. After a few hours, the tale comes to an end. You provide some advice taken from your experiences and offer words of encouragement. The other&rsquo;s face brightens. The now contented one departs, wishing you the blessings of the Most High for all days. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 use)]</p>
