<p class="TaleDestiny">(893) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>A beautiful snake, with scales like glass, slithers near. You gaze at it in wonder.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It raises its head and stares back, and a deep tiredness suffuses your limbs. The snake towers above you and takes the form of a beautiful enchantress. You fall to the ground, now wearing the body of the marvelous snake. The mocking laugh of the enchantress fills your head as you slither off. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The snake speaks. &ldquo;Truly, you are so fair and lovely that my heart is filled with joy. I cannot bring harm unto you. I am one versed in the magical arts, and for the solace your visage has brought me, I shall grant any favor you might ask.&rdquo; [D+2 / S+1 / Choice of Treasure or Opportunity to enter any <a href="PlacesofPower.html">Place of Power</a>]</p>
