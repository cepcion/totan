<p class="TaleDestiny">(1791) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>On a sandy slope, you spy a great black and red pavilion. You are suspicious, so you decide to observe from a safe distance. After a few hours, you see a black giant approaching the pavilion. When he draws back the flap, you see a cage with men trapped inside. Now you know what that meat is on the spit outside the tent!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Afraid that you might share their fate, you quickly retreat back into the forest. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: As you watch the black giant&rsquo;s movements, you devise a scheme to capture him so his prisoners might escape. The next day, when he enters the forest, he does not suspect your pit trap until he is stuck at the bottom of it! You free his captives, and together you slay the monster. [D+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
