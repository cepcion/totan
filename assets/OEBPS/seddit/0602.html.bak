<p>The other whispers to you of the predicament he is in due to his misdeeds and asks you to hide him from the authorities who would punish him.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Reluctantly you agree. To your great surprise, the mercy you show him brings him closer to the faith, and he swears to undertake the Hadj to Mecca, and praises you with every step. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> You are indignant at such a thought, and you loudly denounce the other. All agree publicly that you are righteous in your judgment. Privately, you are thought to be cruel and unfeeling. [D+2 / Lose Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
