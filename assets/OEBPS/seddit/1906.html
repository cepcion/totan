<p class="TaleDestiny">(1906) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>After the sickly other bothers you for hours, you decide that the only way to be rid of him is a sound beating.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You feel much better after flogging the other. Unfortunately, you spent too much time too close to him. Soon, you find that you bear the same affliction. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You know better than to get too close to a sickly wretch like this, so you hire someone to do the deed for you. His technique is impressive, and you learn a few useful tricks yourself.
[D+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
