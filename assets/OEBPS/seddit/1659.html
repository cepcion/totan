<p class="TaleDestiny">(1659) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>A beggar approaches you and asks for a coin. You are tired of giving away your hard-earned wealth to beggars. You offer him a job with you for which you will pay him a fair wage.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The beggar seems quite amused at your offer and turns you down. He sounds quite well-spoken for a beggar and moves on to the next person. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You recognize the beggar as a wizard in disguise. You ask him what he is doing in such a strange ruse. He explains that he wanted to test the generosity of those in the kingdom. He is amused that you would come up with such an offer. He invites you to try the disguise with him. [S+1 / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
