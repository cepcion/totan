<p class="TaleDestiny">(1908) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>No one will risk illness to come to the aid of a diseased wretch like this other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Carefully covering your face, you boldly approach the sickly other and seize his begging bowl full of coins. [W+1 (Max: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: Why use violence to rob the other when his disease-addled brain makes him a perfect mark for a simple swindle? You trick the other into paying you his hard-won coins in exchange for a jar of fine snake oil. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Beguiling]</p>
