<p class="TaleDestiny">(975) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>As you bid him a fine good day, the crotchety old man asks if you have anything he might eat.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are taken aback by his effrontery, and politely decline to aid him. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You give him the last of a pomegranate-and-rosewater confection you prepared with your own hands. After one bite, his eyes widen. &ldquo;Only my child could make such a perfect confection! Truly, could it be thee?&rdquo; Indeed, marvel of marvels, it is your long-lost father! Praise the miracles of the Most High! [D+2 / S+2 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
