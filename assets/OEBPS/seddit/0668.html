<p class="TaleDestiny">(668) - DETERMINED  (M),  ENDURING HARDSHIP, SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>Your ship is caught in a strong current and heads toward the rocks. Should you fight the current or steer around the shoals? Should you furl the sail or use the wind?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your panic prevents you from making a decision, and the ship crashes into the rocks. All is lost! You wash up on a distant shore. [D-1 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / Move to any coastal space]</p>
<p><p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory),  ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: Though the situation is desperate, you retain your composure and act decisively. You fight the current with furled sail, and save the ship. [D+2 / S+2 / Seamanship]</p>
