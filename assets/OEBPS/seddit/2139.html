<p class="TaleDestiny">(2139) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>A storyteller describes an odd ruined city in the mountains south from the city. The entire place is surrounded by a glowing wall of light that bars entry. The barrier is said to repel any who attempt to cross it. This is a tragedy, as the streets of the city shine with gold and the buildings are bedecked with emeralds. You are determined to open this barrier and secure this great wealth. You travel into the mountains, find the wondrous city, and step up to the illuminated barrier.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The light burns your body and staggers your mind. You fall back from its painful radiance. You look down at your body and it is indeed changed. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The passage through the luminosity is excruciatingly painful and seems to last an 
eternity. Your endurance and resilience carries you through and, after a time, you emerge on the other side. Unfortunately, as you examine it closer, the 
city is more show than reality. The gold streets turn out to be an odd play of light on bright sand; the jewels are polished glass. Not all that can be seen 
should be believed. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
