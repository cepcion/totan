<p>You join some pearl divers, hoping to find some of the precious stones at the bottom of the sea. After a long dive, you emerge on the surface to discover that all the other divers have vanished. Instead, you see a company of the Sultan&rsquo;s soldiers! They seize you and accuse you of stealing from the Sultan&rsquo;s pearl bed!</p>

But the Vizier is determined to get his revenge!
