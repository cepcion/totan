<p>The other does not listen to your offers or enticements, but instead binds you hand and foot. Several of his servants carry you away for several days across the sands. One evening, while the other slumbers, you offer to pay the guard double what he is being paid to let you go.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The guard agrees. It isn&rsquo;t until you&rsquo;ve run from the site for an hour that you have no idea where you are or how to make your way back. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: The guard agrees, taking your money and sending you on camel back into the desert. By the time the other realizes what has happened, you have used your superior knowledge of the landscape to elude him. [D+2 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
