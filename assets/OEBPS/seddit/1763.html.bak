<p class="TaleDestiny">(1763) - STORYTELLING, STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>It has long been rumored that the Sultan of the Islands of Camphor, being a favorite of the Caliph himself, has collected an astonishing assortment of curious and beautiful artifacts. Perhaps one of them is the treasure you have been seeking!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You present yourself to the Sultan, hoping to convince him to aid you on your quest, but he is clearly distracted by the affairs of his household and barely has time to listen to your words. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You tell the Sultan the long and involved tale of your quest. By the time you finish your words, the entire court has fallen silent, enraptured by your magnificent tale. The concerns of his house forgotten, the Sultan offers to aid you in your quest in any way he can.
[D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Treasure]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Under cover of night, you find a loose window sash and secretly enter the palace. Making your way to the treasure chamber, you marvel at the glistening wealth before you.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Stealth and Stealing</span> (two if at Master level):</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;8: How could you have known that the platinum parrot in the golden cage was magic? As soon as you touch one of the items in the treasury, it sings so loudly that the guards are upon you before you can react! [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9&ndash;11: You search the room completely, but do not find what you seek. You quietly depart, your presence never discovered.
[S+1 / Wisdom]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">12: There it is! The item you&rsquo;ve been seeking! With all of this treasure, you&rsquo;re sure the Sultan won&rsquo;t miss one little item&hellip; [Treasure]</p>
