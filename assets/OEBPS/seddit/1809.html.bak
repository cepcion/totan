<p class="TaleDestiny">(1809) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>In a marketplace, you observe a strange little man charming a snake with a flute. You are almost entranced by the rhythmic movements and music of the snake charmer. You realize that this could be a very useful skill if you ever encounter a snake. After his performance, you approach him and try to convince him to teach you his secrets.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The man listens to your offers but insists that he cannot teach you. Only members of his religious sect are permitted to know the art that he has demonstrated. Disappointed, you continue your journey. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: After much haggling, you convince the man to show you his methods. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Wilderness Lore]</p>
