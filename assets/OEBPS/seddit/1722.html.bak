<p class="TaleDestiny">(1722) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>As you stand before the Crystal Palace, you shudder at the injustice meted out to the children imprisoned therein. You bring to mind a neighboring Sultan, a ruler well-known for his sense of justice. You know that he would be offended to learn that children were being treated so cruelly. Traveling to his palace, you try to convince him to use his might and power to free the children.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The Sultan is amused by your lack of political understanding. He explains that kings do not simply invade one another due to their unpleasant treatment of their subjects. Disappointed, you leave the court, but you learned some valuable lessons in statecraft. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: A deep study of the family history of both monarchs reveals that they are, in fact, distantly related. You remind the Sultan of an oath he took long ago to see to the welfare of all his relations, no matter how distant. Reluctantly, he sends an envoy to the Crystal Palace to demand the release of his cousins. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
