<p class="TaleDestiny">(2056) - MAGIC</p>
<p>While traveling through a ravine off the beaten path, you come upon a gang of brigands huddled around a pile of gold and jewels, the spoils of a recent raid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try to set up an elaborate distraction that would leave the camp empty, but the brigand leader spots the ruse at the last second and catches you trying to make off with the loot. For your temerity, the leader personally removes your thieving hand before robbing you and sending you on your way. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span> / Reduce your Wealth to Beggar, but gain D+1 for each level lost in this way]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Donning a gravely serious look, you approach the brigands, arms outstretched, hands gesticulating. &ldquo;Behold the Mystic Veil of Umm-Kalzoun!&rdquo; you intone. &ldquo;Criminals, your final hour is at hand!&rdquo; Out of &ldquo;thin air&rdquo; you pull a line of veils tied end to end, each one a different color of the rainbow. The brigands take one look at the &ldquo;magic veil,&rdquo; drop their swords, and run for the hills&mdash;leaving the loot behind. [W+2 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
