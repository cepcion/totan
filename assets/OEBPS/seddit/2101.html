<p class="TaleDestiny">(2101) - PIETY</p>
<p>Tales have reached your ear of a magical mountain that endangers all who venture near it. Yet the only safe pass through these mountains will take you directly past it, and the food in your caravan must reach the far side before those who live beyond succumb to the deep famine there. But you can find no one learned enough to tell you the way to pass in safety. For three days you pray for Allah to show you the way. Finally, you collapse from exhaustion.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your chief drover wakes you in the early morning. A returning caravan from the lands beyond the Magnetic Mountain has reached your camp. The leader of the other caravan is happy to tell you the route he has found. It is much longer, but easily traveled in safety. [S+1]</p>
