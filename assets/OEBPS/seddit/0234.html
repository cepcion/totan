<p class="TaleDestiny">(234) - COURTLY GRACES, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You unwittingly give offense to the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The response he gives you is very cold and very brief. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES, BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You perceive what you have done, and immediately attempt to right the situation with fine words. Allah inspires compassion in him, and he is receptive to your requests. [D+2]</p>
