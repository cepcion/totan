<p class="TaleDestiny">(1741) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>The Barber is out upon some errand when you arrive, so you decide to take a look around his magnificent shop. Within, you discover an incredible collection of bizarre and curious artifacts. Perhaps there is something that will aid you on your quest?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the Barber returns, you tell him your tale, and are rewarded with an incredibly long description of another traveler whose condition was quite similar except totally different in every way, which he describes in maddening detail. It is well past midnight when you finally stumble out of the shop. Only later do you realize that one of the Barber&rsquo;s artifacts somehow made it into your hand. [D+1 / Treasure]</p>
