<p class="TaleDestiny">(1927) - SEDUCTION  (M), SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You notice a mysterious glimmer in the eye of the other as you hand him a few coins. There may be more to this one than you first thought.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You shrug off your intuition and continue on your way. Only later do you discover that you gave him your purse, and you don&rsquo;t remember why. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION  (mandatory):</span> You find yourself strangely attracted to the other, though you cannot be sure why. You return to visit him later in the day, hoping to find yourself drawn into a torrid affair. When your senses return, you discover that he has cast a charm upon you! [D-1 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: This must be some kind of magician in disguise! You quickly avert your gaze before he can charm you with his magic. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
