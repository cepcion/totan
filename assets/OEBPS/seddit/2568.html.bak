<p class="TaleDestiny">(2568) - LUCK, WISDOM</p>
<p>You encounter a gaudily dressed little man with a slick air. Flamboyantly, he describes himself as a merchant, raconteur, and entertainer. He seeks to accompany you and asks only a pittance in return. Intrigued by his dress and demeanor, you agree. During your travels, he lifts your spirits with his stories, jests, and distractions. Your favorite is an odd game using black chips etched with strange symbols. After a couple sessions, he offers to add spice to the game by wagering on the outcome. So challenged, you accept.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The enticing game captivates you. After several days, you find you have lost all of your gold. The diminutive rake packs his bags and wanders off. [W-1 (Min: Poor) / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, WISDOM</span>: After several games, you begin to see patterns and become more accomplished. In time, through luck or great focus, you notice certain telltale signs on the backs of the chips. The little man is hustling you. You grow angry and accuse him. In response, he laughs and nods. He returns your gold and offers a glowing ring as recompense.
