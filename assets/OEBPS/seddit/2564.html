<p class="TaleDestiny">(2564) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You spend all day looking for a fresh camel, as your current one has taken ill. The only man who sells them in town seems hesitant, and after a long day of unsuccessful haggling you retire to a smoke-filled inn, where you gradually doze off. Traveling all these nights, however, has trained you to remain aware of your surroundings, and your hand shoots out before you fully wake to grab the wrist of a woman reaching for your coin purse. Your eyes open and follow the slender arm up to the dirty but beautiful face of the young bandit. &ldquo;Allah does not seem to support your chosen profession,&rdquo; you tell her. &ldquo;But there is something I can use you for.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Realizing that neither wealth nor piety will inspire the local herdsman to sell you a camel, you send the thief to beguile the hard man into giving one to you. The thief proves better as a negotiator, and the next morning you ride off on a fresh mount. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You take the young thief along with you when you go to commandeer a mount for the next leg of your journey. You teach her a few skills and she travels with you for some time learning your trade. Eventually you release her, and hear nothing from her for many nights. Then one night a messenger arrives for you, carrying a strange package. The note is from your apprentice: &ldquo;Dear Master, I wish to repay you for all you taught me. I found this bauble that I believe will better fit your pocket than it will mine.&rdquo; [D+1 / One Hundred Keys]</p>
