<p class="TaleDestiny">(1761) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>Knowing that your good friend, prince Taj el Mulouk, desires princess Dunya of the Islands of Camphor, you devise a plan to get them together. Surely, he can convince her to fall in love with such a kind and generous man!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You and the prince sneak into the palace, past some eunuchs, and into the chambers of princess Dunya. When she discovers you, she is shocked and insulted that a man would sneak into her chambers uninvited! Their romance has been thwarted temporarily, but you learned a few things about sneaking into palaces. [S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Before you sneak into the palace, you give your friend a few good suggestions of how to woo a princess. Though she is, at first, ashamed to have a man sneak into her private chambers, once Prince Taj expresses the depth of his passionate love, you watch her heart melt away. [D+1 / S+1 / Beguiling]</p>
