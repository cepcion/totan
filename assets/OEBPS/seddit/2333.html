<p class="TaleDestiny">(2333) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>The treasure, though small, is breathtaking, as breathtaking as the guards are fierce. You take a step closer and the guards narrow their eyes. You turn away.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As each step carries you further from the treasure, it grows larger in your mind, in your imagination surpassing all else you have seen. For days, the idea of going back to the treasure gnaws at you, and when finally you return, it is gone. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You finger your sword absentmindedly as you walk by. The guards snort derisively at you, &ldquo;Look, he&rsquo;s thinking to make off with the treasure.&rdquo; The guards laugh.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you walk away or do you draw your sword?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you walk away</span>: You will not be forced to what you don&rsquo;t want to do. [D+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you draw your sword</span>: Their laughter insults you and you take up their challenge. Your dazzling display of swordsmanship leaves many wounds upon the guards. However, you do not take the now-unguarded treasure, as a final rebuff to their derision. [D+1 / S+1]</li>
