<p class="TaleDestiny">(2081) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>While praying at the mosque, you overhear a ship&rsquo;s captain discussing his plans to rob one of his wealthy passengers, throw the man overboard and report his death as an accident.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You pray to Allah for guidance, but no message of clarity arrives to guide your hand. You take the matter before the local authorities, but they tell you that your word regarding another&rsquo;s intent to commit a crime is not in itself proof of guilt. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Seeing the hand of Fate in these events, you take it upon yourself to gain passage on the captain&rsquo;s ship by posing as a crew member. Once on board you thwart the captain&rsquo;s plan to rob the wealthy passenger, and in return the passenger gives you his eternal thanks&hellip; and a substantial reward! [D+2 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
