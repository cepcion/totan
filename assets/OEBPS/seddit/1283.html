<p class="TaleDestiny">(1283) - STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>You discover a small door with strange words on it. At the sound of the spell, the door opens! A dark musty tunnel opens into a vast maze.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you finally come to the treasure room you are completely lost. Stumbling about, you faint from hunger and thirst. You awaken outside the caves. [D+2 / S+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, QUICK THINKING</span>: You bring to mind the tale of Alee of Cairo, who left behind him a trail of possessions to thread a maze. After a number of hours in the maze, you come to a vast treasure room! You fill your pockets, then follow your trail of clothing, paper, and food back to the entrance. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Quick Thinking]</p>
