<p class="TaleDestiny">(863) - SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>The other watches as you head away, and you feel yourself being stared at the whole time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You can&rsquo;t be bothered and continue walking. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You decide to stop; you have not heard of the other causing trouble in this part of the world and a friendly greeting might secure relations with the other. The other proves to be friendly and talkative. Your knowledge of the oceans of the world impresses him and when it is time for the other to leave, you are given a great gift.
