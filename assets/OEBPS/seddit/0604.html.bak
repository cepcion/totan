<p class="TaleDestiny">(604) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>The slave is a bargain, and you quickly buy him. However, when you have concluded your purchase, your new slave begs you to bid for the next slave as well&mdash;a beautiful maiden. He says they are in love and cannot bear to be parted. Unfortunately she is much more expensive.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Reluctantly you purchase her as well. The happy couple serve you joyfully, and praise you for your kindness. In time, you realize how fortunate are to have such faithful servants. [D+2 / S+1 / W-2 (Min: Beggar) / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, STORYTELLING</span>: You wait until the bidding is over and another has bought the maiden. You then approach the man who has purchased the female slave, and in great detail and with many superlative expressions, you relate to him the tragic tale of the star-crossed lovers. Moved to tears by your emotional performance, the new owner frees the maiden. The happy couple serve you faithfully. [D+3 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
