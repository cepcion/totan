<p class="TaleDestiny">(1792) - SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>Far from the nearest town or village, you encounter a man running for his life. He tells you of his harrowing escape from a vicious black giant who keeps men in his pavilion not far away. Every day at noon he cooks one of the unfortunate men and makes a meal of him. You decide to watch this giant and see if there is some way to rescue his prisoners.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: From what the man told you, the giant spends every morning out in the forest collecting herbs and spices for his meal. The next morning, while he is gone, you approach the pavilion.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Stealth and Stealing</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;6: The giant returns early! You try to fight him, but he is too mighty for you and you are forced to flee! [D-1 / S+1]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">7+: You are able to open the crude cage and release the men inside before the giant returns. They thank you for your bravery and selflessness. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You see that some of the herbs the giant uses could easily be confused with a dangerous poison. You sneak into his tent and swap some of the poison for his herbs. After his next meal, he falls deathly ill, and the men in his cage are able to escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
