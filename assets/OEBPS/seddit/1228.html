<p class="TaleDestiny">(1228) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The ocean is beautiful, and below are the giant oysters which contain the pearls. You put your hand in one&mdash;it shuts! You are trapped.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your only hope is to crawl inside the oyster. Soon it is swallowed by a gigantic fish, and the fish is caught by fishermen. When they cut you from the oyster, there is much laughter at your expense.
[D+1 / S+2 / Lose Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You grimly hold your breath until you are rescued. You also grimly hold onto a handful of pearls. [D+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)]</p>
