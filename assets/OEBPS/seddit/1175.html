<p class="TaleDestiny">(1175) - EBONY HORSE, FLYING CARPET</p>
<p>You hear cries of distress from a person standing in the uppermost window. Looking up, you see her visage is like unto the sun upon water!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are turned aside by the guard at every attempt to enter, and never manage to enter the palace. [D-1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">EBONY HORSE, FLYING CARPET</span>: You fly over the walls of the palace and rescue the distressed one from such a vile plight.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are not Married</span>: The beauty of the one you have saved seems even greater as you hold tightly to each other in the air, and even when you are safely on the ground again, you remain in each other&rsquo;s arms for a long while. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are Married</span>: The one you have rescued leads you across the lands to the palace of a powerful Sultan. He showers you with honors and gifts for rescuing his oldest child, and offers you the child&rsquo;s hand in marriage. You must decline, though, for the love of your spouse. [D+2 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Robe of Honor</span>]</li>
