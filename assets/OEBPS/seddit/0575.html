<p class="TaleDestiny">(575) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>You discover to your regret that your victim was only pretending to be occupied. As your hand falls upon the purse, he leaps on you and shouts for help.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Others gather immediately and you are carted off for judgment. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: The other&rsquo;s nose is bent and his face warty, while your countenance is like that of the full moon. The crowd naturally thinks you the victim, and they cart him off for judgment. You make haste to be elsewhere before the truth is discovered. [D+2 / S+1 / Have another player move you one space in any direction]</p>
