<p>You are intrigued by the shards of enormous eggshells you stumble upon during your journey. What kind of magnificent creature could have come from within? Following the trail of broken shells, you are amazed to find a blind roc hatchling! You quickly bind the creature and present it the Sultan as a gift. The Sultan is astounded by your generosity and demands that you remain in his court for a time. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
