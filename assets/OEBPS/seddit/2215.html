<p class="TaleDestiny">(2215) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Filled with bravado, you draw your blade and boldly demand payment from the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other&rsquo;s eyes go wide in disbelief. You are robbing someone who is in chains? The other laughs heartily, wounding your pride. [D+2 /
S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Seeing the surety of your grip, the other cries out for the guards to deal with you. With swift steel you strike down the guards and repeat your original demand. Amazed that you knew he had something hidden from his captors, he pulls it out from inside his robes for you. [D+1 / S+2 / Treasure]</p>
