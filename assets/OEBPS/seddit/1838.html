<p class="TaleDestiny">(1838) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>You find a band of men who have killed an enormous rhinoceros. You examine the remains, finding particularly intriguing the creature&rsquo;s bizarre horn.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: One of the older hunters tells you a fascinating tale about the rhino and its horn. Far to the east, he says, doctors use the powder of the horn to ease fevers and treat the &ldquo;falling sickness.&rdquo; You trade him a handful of coins for a sample of the horn in case you find a use for it in the future. [S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You realize that the rarity of the rhino may make its horn as valuable as the ivory tusks of elephants. After a bit of haggling, you convince the hunters to let you take the horn. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
