<p class="TaleDestiny">(2114) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>A band of brigands has been raiding caravans near the infamous Magnetic Mountain. The Sultan&rsquo;s soldiers are helpless to react, as whenever they draw near, their own weapons are stripped from their hands and pulled by the mighty magic of the Mountain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After long hours of study, you are able to learn the brigands&rsquo; secret. The magical forces of the Magnetic Mountain do not affect the sun-colored metal brass. Working with the Sultan&rsquo;s craftsmen, you manufacture enough brass weapons to equip one hundred men, and lead them to capture the brigands. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: After some trial and error, you find the very edge of the Mountain&rsquo;s magnetic effect. Then you wait for the brigands to appear. On seeing them, you stand and draw your bow. The steel tips of your arrows gain tremendous speed and power as they are drawn to the mountain, by passing through the bodies of the cruel bandits! The Sultan rewards you well for ridding his kingdom of such evil men. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
