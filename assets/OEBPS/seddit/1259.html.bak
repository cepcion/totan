<p class="TaleDestiny">(1259) - SEAMANSHIP  (M), LUCK</p>
<p>A large fleet appears on the horizon. You turn the ship to flee, but you are not sure you can outrun them. Their ships fly unfamiliar banners, and you know these are dangerous waters.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, SEAMANSHIP  (mandatory):</span> You throw some of your cargo overboard to lighten your load, calculating that escaping with half your goods is better than being captured with all of them. Your sailing skill allows you to evade them, and soon you are again alone on the waves.
[D+1 / Seamanship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You act on a hunch and sail towards them. Lo, they are no pirates, but a huge merchant fleet. You trade with them and make a large profit.
