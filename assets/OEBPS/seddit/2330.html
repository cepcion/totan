<p class="TaleDestiny">(2330) - None</p>
<p>To your amazement, a merman invites you under the waters to dine with his family. At the dinner table, before you can eat, everyone holds hands and prays for the food on the table. Then you join the merfolk as they dance around the table&mdash;three times to the left, then three times to the right. You don&rsquo;t understand what is going on, but you have worked up such an appetite so that when the prayers are done you are eager to eat.
