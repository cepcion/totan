<p class="TaleDestiny">(2006) - PIETY</p>
<p>You join a crowd watching a young man as he draws patterned cards from a face-down pile. He becomes increasingly flushed when an oily entertainer guesses the image on the face of that card over and over again. When the young man&rsquo;s coin purse is empty, he accuses the performer of cheating him. The card sharp takes offense and daggers are drawn. You step forward, beseeching the pair to trust in Allah and seek his judgment.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The two turn on you, resenting your interference. Still, by expending their derision and passion on you, their anger with each other cools and they depart without further incident. [D+2]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: You deliver a bold and insightful prayer to Allah, weaving in observations about the two men and how greater faith would aid them. The combatants are touched, forget their dispute, and bow down with you. The slick operator reveals the trick behind his perfect guessing, and offers to return the dupe his coins. The fleeced one comes to appreciate the skill behind the scam, and urges the entertainer to keep half the monies. The crowd is uplifted by this resolution. [D+2 / S+2 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
