<p class="TaleDestiny">(2316) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>The slave is running from merchant to merchant, trying to complete the tasks set to him by his master: He has no time to discuss business with you&mdash;if he is late, he will suffer a rude beating. If you truly want his services, you will need to purchase him from his master.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you wish to purchase him, and do you have a Wealth level of at least Rich?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do not want to purchase this slave or have Wealth less than Rich</span>: You thank him and go on your way. [D+1]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you do want to purchase this slave</span>: You go to his master&rsquo;s home and ask to purchase the slave. The man asks for a lot of money, far more than the slave is worth.</li>
<ul class="SubTaleSkill">
<li class="MidSubTaleSkill"><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You realize this is not worth the time or effort to pursue, and you go about your way. [D+1]</li>
<li><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You are able to haggle with the owner and bring down the price to a fair amount. The slave proves incredibly able and even teaches you a few things. [D+1 / S+1 / (Min: Poor) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</li>
