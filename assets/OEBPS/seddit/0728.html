<p class="TaleDestiny">(728) - PIETY</p>
<p>Flames dance before your eyes, and you cannot tear yourself away. You are being absorbed into the weird, rhythmic flickering.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You reach for the fire and you are trapped! A tongue of flame pierces your head, burning with the pain of a thousand deaths. You scream as you feel the flame wrap around your mind and take control. Dazed, you touch your temple, and discover that the flame has left no mark&mdash;yet you can feel it in your mind still, controlling your very self. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: The flame of your faith burns higher than the unholy flames of the mystical fire. You resist the enchantment and turn away. When you turn back, the flames are gone. [D+2 / Piety]</p>
