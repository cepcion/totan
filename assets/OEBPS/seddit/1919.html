<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Though the other has no news to assist you, he is pleased by your information. You learn some useful ideas to improve your presentation, though. [S+1 / Appearance]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: The other tells you some very interesting things about some trade routes you are familiar with. Together, you develop a very profitable scheme. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
