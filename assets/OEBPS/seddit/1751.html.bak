<p class="TaleDestiny">(1751) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You are cheerfully making your way through town when a stranger accosts you. &ldquo;Please, for the love of Allah! You must help me escape his unceasing chatter!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hide the stranger in an empty basket, among those in a market stand, just as the Barber approaches to ask if you have seen his friend. While the Barber distracts you, the merchant begins to carry off his baskets, and you are forced to buy the one hiding the stranger before he is discovered. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You quickly look around the bazaar for any suitable disguise. &ldquo;Quick, put this on!&rdquo; You instruct the stranger, handing him a woman&rsquo;s dress and veil. You pretend to haggle with a merchant for the &ldquo;slave woman&rdquo; as the confused Barber passes by. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
