<p>You bow gracefully before the other.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He takes advantage of your vulnerable position and attacks you. He beats you senseless, robs you, and leaves you for dead. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You happen to look up to see him drawing his sword to attack you. Forewarned by this stroke of luck, you easily parry his blow. Returning the attack upon him, you wound him in one swift stroke. He has not reckoned on your skill with arms and turns on his heels. You give chase, but he is swift of foot and evades you. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> The Brass Trumpet sounds out its clear note of warning, and the other hesitates in his attack. You draw your sword and defend yourself, driving the other away. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
