<p class="TaleDestiny">(2285) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You decide that the best punishment that you can deliver is to send the other to his grave.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you are looting his body, a shadow looms over you.</p>
<p>The one you defeated has a loyal companion who is prepared to take revenge! He has caught you unaware and you are at his mercy. [D+1 / W-3 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You realize that the other you have defeated has a companion who is surely going to seek revenge. You quickly don the other&rsquo;s robes and muffle your face. When the companion comes, you pretend to be his friend and report that though you have slain your foe, you are afraid that he was a leper and now you are infected. The companion collects food, money, and a cart and horse for you to travel to a leper colony. You bid him a fine farewell as you depart with your booty. [S+2 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
