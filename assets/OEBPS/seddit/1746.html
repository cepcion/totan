<p>Will this troublesome barber ever give you peace? You came here to get a little medical advice, but now he insists on telling you the sad tale of every brother he has! He&rsquo;s only on the third story, and he says he has seven brothers&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: To your amazement, the barber insists that you accompany him to visit the Sultan himself! He is, you discover, the court physician, where his many tales and broad knowledge often amuse the Sultan. You could learn a lot from this strange old man! [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Finally! Another customer has entered the store and the barber has turned his attention to the new arrival. Perhaps you can make your escape while he is distracted. [S+1]</p>
