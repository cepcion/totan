<p class="TaleDestiny">(1482) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>A torrent of compliments rolls from your lips. The other is temporarily distracted from his wrathful course.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After a time the other takes his leave to pursue his revenge. Your delay proves enough for his victim to escape. The other vows revenge on you! [D+2 / S+1 / Pursued]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: Your words play through the other&rsquo;s mind, soothing his rage and giving him time to consider his course. The other lets go of his need for revenge, and instead directs his passion toward pursuing another target: you! [D+1 / S+1] <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
