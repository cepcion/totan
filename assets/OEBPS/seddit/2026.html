<p class="TaleDestiny">(2026) - SCHOLARSHIP, LUCK</p>
<p>You are accosted by the other, who asks for alms.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You give the other some money on the condition that he spend it wisely. You even follow him to make sure, but soon you are led to an abode of many unfortunates and the smell emanating from the area is overwhelming. Better, you decide, to have given the money away than to have traced its journey. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP, LUCK</span>: There is something about the other that bothers you, yet you give some money and get a toothless smile as reward. The other hobbles away, but your instinct compels you to follow&mdash;and you end up in front of an opulent estate where slaves come out, remove the decrepit clothing from the figure, and dress him in rich robes. Rather than becoming angry, you laugh to yourself: certainly it was worth a few coins to learn from a true master. [S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
