<p>Surely only a fool would dare to attack such an enormous fleet of warships! Yet, foolish or not, when you learn that the fleet intends to destroy your beloved city, you attack.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Outnumbered a hundredfold, your small vessel has no hope of victory. You can only hope that your interference has delayed them long enough for the city to prepare its defenses. [D+1 / S+1 / Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Small ships such as yours have a huge advantage over the large war vessels of this fleet: mobility. Using your speed and mobility, you sow confusion among the fleet and cause many to collide. You pray that you have damaged their fleet enough to save your city. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
