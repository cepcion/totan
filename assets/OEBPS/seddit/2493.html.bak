<p class="TaleDestiny">(2493) - ENDURING HARDSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Walking your horse along a path by some water, you are beset by the other, raving about a missing love whom he apparently thinks you have abducted. With a flash of your blade, you quickly disarm him. He bursts into tears and tells you of his betrothed, who was taken by a traveler just like yourself several days ago. He is desperate to discover her fate.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You berate him, calling him a fool and a criminal. He renews his attack and you wound him severely. As you travel on, you regret your rash action. [D+1 / Lose Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You feel pity for the other, for you have felt such loss in your heart before. You spend several days searching the local area. Although the terrain is harsh and inhospitable, you find some tracks leading to a nearby village. There you pick up the trail of the one who took the man&rsquo;s love. Grateful, the other tells you of his courtship and how he plans to greet his love when he finds her. [D+1 / S+1 / Seduction]</p>
