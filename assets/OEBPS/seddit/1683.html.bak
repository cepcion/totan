<p class="TaleDestiny">(1683) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>Far from the eyes of civilization, you hear of a wealthy man who stages horrifying shows for the public&rsquo;s amusement. You arrive in the secret location to find a jinni trapped in a magical circle and an audience throwing dung and eggs at it, each missile calling forth a bellow of rage. You cannot let this monstrosity stand, so you declare that if the jinni is freed from its torment, you will stand an hour in its place. The crowd, already bored of their entertainment, call for you to enter the circle.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As soon as you enter the circle, you flee out the other side. The crowd chases you, hurling rocks and knives, many of which gash you horribly. But you soon evade your pursuers. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You stand in the circle, ducking the worst of the missiles, letting no word escape your lips as the crowd taunts you. After the promised hour, you are released. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Determined</span>]</p>
