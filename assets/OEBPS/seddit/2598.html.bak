<p>You are amazed by the fine steed you see outside the stables of the emir. You wonder how you might acquire such a mount for yourself and seek help from a local merchant friend.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The merchant tells you that you could not hope to purchase the horse, for it belongs to a distant cousin of the emir who is due any day to reclaim it. Together, you make a plan to disguise yourself as the emir&rsquo;s cousin and trick the emir into giving you the horse. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY  (mandatory):</span> When your friend tells you the story of the owner of the horse, you realize that you cannot with clear conscience steal such a wondrous beast. You leave empty-handed but with a warm heart.
