<p>As you journey, a voice both clear and strong address you thusly: &ldquo;I beg your pardon, but could you direct me to civilization?&rdquo; You turn, and are befuddled to see that the one who addressed you was a horse!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You calculate the value of this miraculous creature and speak at great length to it, trying to connive some trick by which to lure the beast into following you. Alarmed at the tone of your voice, it runs off.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: With careful and clever motions, you smoothly win its trust and entice it into a trap. You display this strange beast to all, for a fee, and you turn a fine profit, finally selling the beast to the Sultan for his menagerie. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
