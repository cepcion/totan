<p class="TaleDestiny">(1025) - WILDERNESS LORE, SCHOLARSHIP, ACCURSED  (M)</p>
<p>You meet an unusual woman on the road and offer to accompany her. When she goes to &ldquo;obey a call of nature,&rdquo; she tarries so long you go after her. You find her speaking to her children&mdash;a flock of gools! She tells them of the fleshy feast she will bring them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You make to leave unseen, but her voice seem to cast a spell upon you, and, against your will, you return. Luckily, a passing troop of soldiers scare her and her brood away, but your mind is still caught up in her spell. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, SCHOLARSHIP</span>: Acquainted with the sorcery of goolehs, you recognize your peril. Blocking your ears against her enchantments, you escape the moment you know her identity. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACCURSED  (mandatory):</span> At the sound of this you smother an exclamation and begin to make a quiet retreat. Some passing breeze seems to bring your smell to her, however, and she howls to her children to follow, then leaps after you. Fear lends wings to your feet, and you would have escaped but for your accursed luck. A stone in the path turns under your feet, and before you recover they are on you. The family of gools give you time to make peace with your God, and your display of piety, combined with your supreme tastiness, is so ennobling that the gooleh and her progeny decide to convert to Islam on the spot. Their profession of the True Faith is too late to help you as you warm their bellies, but they do take to assisting lone travelers in honor of your memory. [Death]</p>
