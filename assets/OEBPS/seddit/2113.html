<p class="TaleDestiny">(2113) - ACTING AND DISGUISE, STEALTH AND STEALING, BRASS BOW</p>
<p>A powerful magician has established domination over the area. Secure in his stronghold atop the Magnetic Mountain, he has ensured that no armed man can challenge him, and his black magics are more than enough to defeat any unarmed adventurer. Enraged by the injustice of his rule, you offer to help the enslaved populace.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Emboldened by your resolve, you climb the mountain to confront the sorcerer. But like so many before you, his magics are too great for you, and you soon find yourself enslaved as well! [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Enslaved</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You overwhelm one of the thugs the magician employs to terrorize the peasants. Disguised in his garments, you easily enter the magician&rsquo;s stronghold. That night, you sneak into his chambers while he is communing with dark spirits. You steal away with his brass ring and bell, the source of his mysterious magnetic powers. Without their protection, the magician is helpless when you lead the people against him. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Sultan</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS BOW</span>: Without fear or hesitation, you take a stand at the base of the mysterious mountain. The magician looks down at you with an evil grin until he sees you raise your bow of brass. Fear twists his features as you pull arrow to your ear and let fly. Enhanced by the magic of the bow, and drawn by the magnetic power of the mountain, the arrow flies unerringly the full league between you and the magician, striking him in the eye! The magic broken, the mountain collapses in a shower of shattered stone and lost wealth. The grateful people give you your pick of the treasure. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Treasure]</p>
