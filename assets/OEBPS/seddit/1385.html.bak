<p class="TaleDestiny">(1385) - WEAPON USE, UNDER GEAS  (M)</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A sword stroke lays you low, and the grinning Bedouins leave you for dead. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Your efforts are too little.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are female or Married</span>: Your sword turns the tables. The Bedouins flee for their lives and the grateful merchant offers you a portion of his wealth. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / Weapon Use]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: Your sword turns the tables. The Bedouins flee for their lives and the grateful merchant offers you a portion of his wealth or his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage. She is fair as a sparkling stream, and you consider long your decision. [D+2 / S+2 / Weapon Use / Choice of W+2 (Max: Rich) or <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">UNDER GEAS  (mandatory):</span> Alas, this detour from your quest has proven your undoing. As you attack the Bedouins, your mind is drawn irresistibly from the details of the battle around you, back to duty which was laid upon you. A grinning Bedouin takes advantage of this distraction to wound you mortally. You survive long enough to slay him and six of his brothers, before the fountain of blood drains your strength and you perish, calling the justice of Allah down on their heads as you fall to their cowardly knives. [Death]</p>
