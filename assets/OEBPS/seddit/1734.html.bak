<p>Bravely, you agree to approach the apes and negotiate a settlement between them and the villagers. After tracking through the forest for hours, you find their encampment, and you are surprised to discover that by day they are normal human beings!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are captured by the ape-men. Fearing that you will reveal their secret, they force you to drink from the tainted well that cursed them all. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Knowing the ape-men&rsquo;s secret, you melt back into the shadows of the woods and report your findings to the Prince. He heaps rewards upon you as he prepares to attack the ape-men in their weaker, human state. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
