<p class="TaleDestiny">(2553) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>It is a magnificent device, brass and slender. Through one end, you can see the far end of the market up close as if by magic. As you handle the tube, sun flashes on its polished surface. This startles a nearby horse, which bolts, pulling his loaded cart behind it. The cart tears away from the harness and slams into the soft mud wall of the jail. The wall comes crashing down, and from inside stream more than a dozen prisoners! You walk off casually, hoping no one had seen the cause of the commotion. Later, one of the prisoners corners you in an alley. She threatens to report your actions if you do not help her escape the town. &ldquo;Look over there!&rdquo; you yell, then knock the woman unconscious and sling her over your horse.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You carry the woman back to the jail, dumping her in a nearby alley. Then you quickly leave town. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You return the unconscious woman to the jail, explaining that you&mdash;a coincidental witness to the accident&mdash;caught this woman trying to escape. You warn them you have struck her quite hard on the head, so she may be delirious when she awakens. You caution the guards not to believe any of the nonsense she spouts. You claim a modest reward from the guards and head off on your way. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable / Quick Thinking]</p>
