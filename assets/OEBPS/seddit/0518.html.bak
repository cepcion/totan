<p>As you attempt to pass, the other grips your wrist and will not let go until you give him a gift. You cannot break from his grasp.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Rather than have him cling to you for the rest of your life, you pay. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You pretend to be cowed and offer to take him to your abode where you store your wealth. You instead lead him to a place where many of your friends are gathered, and he is dealt with as he deserves. [D+2 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
