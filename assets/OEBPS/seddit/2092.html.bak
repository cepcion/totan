<p class="TaleDestiny">(2092) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>You are dragged before the captain and asked to sit. He glances about constantly, as if being followed. &ldquo;Life is a riddle,&rdquo; he says with a desperate menace. &ldquo;There is one riddle in particular which haunts my every hour: What walks on four legs in the morning,&rdquo; the captain asks, &ldquo;On two legs at noon and three legs at night?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your eyes light up with giddy recollection / A man!&rdquo; you cry. &ldquo;The answer is &lsquo;a man&rsquo;!&rdquo; The captain gasps with certainty at your wisdom.
[D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You know this one from the ancient stories of the Greeks and tell the captain calmly, &ldquo;A man.&rdquo; Then you further explain the full story of the ancient king Oedipus and how he defeated the riddling Sphinx. The fear and madness visibly flee from him as he listens, and when you are done, he is barer the same man. He showers you with gifts for your wisdom. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
