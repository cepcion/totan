<p>Walking along the road, you notice an indolent other lounging by a tree. Barely moving, the youth tells a sad tale. &ldquo;I am terribly lazy and refused to work to support my family. An old crone happened by and cursed me. I must tell my story to all who pass. I cannot truly live again until someone pays me to perform a task. Do you have a few coins to spare for some service, carrying your satchels, or fetching some water? I beg you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Taking pity on the poor wretch, you drop a few coins in the dirt and say, &ldquo;Fetch me some water.&rdquo; The youth bounds up and does so.
[D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: You know just the thing to cure this soul of any lingering laziness. You are aware of house&rsquo;s master who requires able-bodied helpers. You offer a single coin and tell the youth to report to the house. Arriving with him, the master lauds your aid and offers you a &ldquo;finder&rsquo;s fee.&rdquo; [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
