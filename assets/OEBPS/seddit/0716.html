<p class="TaleDestiny">(716) - LUCK</p>
<p>A maelstrom of light suddenly springs up and envelops you. The din is so great and the light so bright you are deafened and dazzled. Your voice is lost in the tumult.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When the storm has passed, you are still shouting and groping and stumbling&mdash;deaf, blind, and raving with madness. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Miraculously, your cry was heard by a passing &rsquo;efreeteh who takes pity on you and snatches you out of danger.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are female or Married</span>: She teaches you a charm to protect you from such perils. [D+2]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">Otherwise</span>: She is overcome with longing for you, and you drink in her enchanted beauty. She is long of limb and full of breast. The love of the People of the Fire is like that of mortals, but more exhausting, and when you are finished, she does not wish to be parted from you. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</li>
