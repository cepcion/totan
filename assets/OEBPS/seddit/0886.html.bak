<p>As you are walking in leisure, the sky grows dark. Above you passes the greatest flock of birds ever you have seen! Intrigued, you resolve to follow them.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After many hours, the flock passes from your sight, and you are no wiser to their nature than before. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED (mandatory), WILDERNESS LORE, SEAMANSHIP</span>: Long after they have vanished from sight, you still follow them, until after long traveling you come to a tiny island upon which the birds nest as densely as hairs in an old man&rsquo;s beard. Satisfied, you return to where you were. Later, you tell this story to a famous scholar, who marvels at your account and swears to aid you if ever he can assist you. [S+1 / Scholarship at Master level (1 use)]</p>
