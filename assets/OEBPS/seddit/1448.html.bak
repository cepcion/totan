<p class="TaleDestiny">(1448) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (M)</p>
<p>You try to fool the other into granting you a favor, feeling that he would not be likely to grant your request directly. You spin a complex lie which tells of the great benefit that will come to him if he aids you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your lie is transparent, and he is not fooled for an instant. Instead, he punishes you severely for your duplicity. [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN  (mandatory):</span> You immediately sense that your lie is not convincing the other, and you change tactics; your lie becomes a parable of the rewards that await those who aid others. The other is moved by your words, and when you request his aid directly, it is granted. [D+1 / S+1 / Storytelling]</p>
