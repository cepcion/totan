<p class="TaleDestiny">(2403) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Before the house of a wealthy merchant, a fearsome &rsquo;efreet stands guard. You plead not to be harmed. &ldquo;I have no wish to harm you. But I am bound by love and promise to remain here until such time as I successfully defend this home from an enemy.&rdquo; The other looks at you more closely. &ldquo;You can help me, and I, in turn, can make your business within a success.&rdquo; The plan requires you to attack the &rsquo;efreet in an effort to enter the abode without due introduction.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You comply, stabbing at the creature with your sword. A simple gesture turns your weapon into dust: then a clap of thunder shakes the abode. &ldquo;I am free!&rdquo; The â€˜efreet disappears into the house for a moment and then returns, carrying a screaming youth. &ldquo;Now you are mine to love forever!&rdquo; you hear the &rsquo;efreet say before flying away. The merchant comes out wailing in anguish at the abduction of his child. You leave before the merchant notices you, but word of your foolishness still travels around. [<span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: There is something not right about the whole idea. Your hesitation proves fruitful as just then, the merchant appears. &ldquo;Ah, I see you have met my slave. Formerly he plagued my home in an attempt to abduct my daughter for a lover, but by cunning I have bound him here to watch over the place instead. He makes for a good guard against outside thieves and scoundrels.&rdquo; Moving inside, you conclude your business to your great profit. [S+1 / W+3 (Max: Rich)]</p>
