<p class="TaleDestiny">(2411) - WEAPON USE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>Nothing truly good happens to mortals who deal with the People of the Flame, so you seek to avoid the presence of the other, who seems to be fascinated by you. But you soon find out that avoiding such a creature is no easy task, so you hope a show of force will make your intentions clear.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other laughs at your gesture and with a wave of contempt, sends you hurtling miles away. You land on thick, soft brush. At least you are alive, and now, apparently free from the attentions of the other. [S+1 / Have another player move you to any forest space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: The other&rsquo;s contemptuous laughter at your gesture is cut short as your weapon strikes deep, causing showers of sparks to explode at the point of impact. Slowly, the other fades away. [D+2]</p>
