<p>As you propose a business deal to the other, he cries out, &ldquo;You would take advantage of my desperate situation to drive a hard bargain? Pfah! I would never deal with such a dishonorable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You cannot prove your honesty, and nothing comes of your offer but a tarnished reputation. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Your reputation is without blemish, and those around verify your integrity. Seeing the truth, the other deals fairly with you.
