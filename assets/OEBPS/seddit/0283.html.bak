<p>&ldquo;Your words are most kind, but I must insist upon greater proof than mere chit-chat,&rdquo; says the other. &ldquo;To prove your love, you must demonstrate the depth of your devotion. First, shave off your hair, then shave and paint your private parts red&hellip;&rdquo;	</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, SEDUCTION  (mandatory):</span> So great is your love that you do not realize that you being made a fool&hellip; until you run naked into a barber shop and all the men laugh uproariously at you. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You are cautious in your affairs, and you do not wish to become involved with one who is obviously mad. However, your heart still yearns for the other, and your suffering is great. [D+2 / Enduring Hardship]</p>
