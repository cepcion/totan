<p>He says, &ldquo;You are brave to come so near. Can I trust you to exact my vengeance upon the evil Vizier who has brought me to this condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You listen to his tale, and consider the request, but it is too dangerous. In fact, you may have spent too much time talking to the wretched other. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Diseased</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: The other&rsquo;s tale is so compelling and piteous that it strikes a sad note in your heart, and you are moved to undertake the task. Your plan for vengeance is just and successful, and the Vizier is revealed as corrupt. The Sultan is thankful, and appoints you as the evil Vizier&rsquo;s replacement. [D+2 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Vizier</span>]</p>
