<p>An old junkseller gives you a pierced coin on a necklace for a good price. You polish it, watch it glitter, and find your mind drifting&hellip; You snap to alertness and realize you have a hypnotic coin!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try out the coin on a rich rug seller. It works! You try it again and again. You grow wealthy but soon you realize that you no longer care for anything other than wealth.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">You may keep the coin or throw it away:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you keep it</span>: Over time, your mind is warped by its power. [D-1 / S+1 / W+6 (Max: Princely) / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span> / You may, at any point, choose to lose either or both of these statuses, but doing so requires reducing your wealth to Beggar)</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you throw it away</span>: You realize that you are surely damned if you keep it. With Allah as your guide, you throw the coin away and give all your goods to the poor to atone for your crimes. [D+1 / S+2 / W=Beggar) / Piety]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You know that such toys are seductive. You keep the coin but use its power sparingly. [D+2 / S+1 / Beguiling at Master level (1 use)]</p>
