<p>The other laughs mockingly when you offer him alms. &ldquo;Can you not see that I have no use for your pity?&rdquo; He continues to laugh as he turns his back to you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The locals are attracted by the other&rsquo;s laughter and soon they join in mocking you. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: The other turns and bumps into a short-tempered magician, who transforms him into an ape! Thus is mockery repaid with mockery! [D+1 / S+1]</p>
