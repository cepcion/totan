<p class="TaleDestiny">(1800) - STEALTH AND STEALING, WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Seeing the men trapped in his cage, doomed to be the dreadful giant&rsquo;s next meal, fills you with an uncontrollable rage. You decide that the giant must die for his sins.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You notice a large boulder up the slope from the giants pavilion. If you can get it rolling, it should crush the giant in his sleep. It takes a fair amount of digging and pushing, but you finally get it rolling. The boulder crashes into the pavilion with a resounding crash, sending men and debris flying. You assume the giant was slain, as you see no sign of him again. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Late in the night, you creep into the tent, your movements more than covered by the sound of the giant&rsquo;s hideous snoring. His eyes flash open just in time to see your face as you deliver deadly retribution. One of the men you freed is a wealthy merchant, who gladly pays you a reward for his rescue. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You charge into the pavilion, scimitar in hand. You catch the monster by surprise, dealing a terrible blow to his leg. Despite the pain of his wound, the creature is mighty in battle, and in just a few moments you are left a bleeding wreck in the back of the tent. Fortunately, the cage was destroyed in the fight, and one of the freed men drags you with him when he makes his escape. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
