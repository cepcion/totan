<p class="TaleDestiny">(896) - LUCK, QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>You have cornered a small beast that you discovered gnawing on your belongings. You raise your weapon to deal it a death blow, but are transfixed as it turns its gaze upon you. Your limbs grow weary&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are as a statue, having no control over your actions. All that you do, is as the actions of a puppet. When feeling returns to your limbs, you sigh with relief. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK, QUICK THINKING, GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: You quickly avert your eyes from its gaze, and the thing scampers off. You do not regret its departure. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
