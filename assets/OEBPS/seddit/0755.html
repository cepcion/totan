<p class="TaleDestiny">(755) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>The howling wind drives bits of sand into your eyes. You can hardly draw breath or speak.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You realize that the gravest danger is from suffocating on the sand, and carefully cover your mouth and nose with cloth. You stumble on, and finally the storm passes. Lo! There is another unfortunate traveler half-buried in the sand. You pull him out, and he praises you to the One God for delivering him from certain death! [D+1 / Luck / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span> (1 turn)]</p>
