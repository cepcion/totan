<p class="TaleDestiny">(1329) - MAGIC</p>
<p>You order ladders built. A man climbs to the top of the walls, cries out, and leaps to his death. Climbing the ladder, you see visions of delights within the city; you realize a protective enchantment guards the city.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You order the others to remain below while you enter. You discover the source of the spell and study it. When you return, your companions lie dead at the ladder&rsquo;s foot, drawn to their doom by the visions. [D+2 / S+2 / Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You break the enchantment with one of your own. You and your men spend a week within the fabulous city, availing yourself of its great treasures. [D+3 / S+3 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Scholarship / Treasure]</p>
