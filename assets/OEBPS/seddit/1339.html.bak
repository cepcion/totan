<p>You stride boldly through the gate, and find ruins and skeletons within, all covered with a layer of dust. You come upon a shop which sold jewels; they are spilling out into the dust.</p>

<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION, STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You realize they are fakes. In your further investigation, however, you find pottery and stonework priceless in its antiquity. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Treasure]</p>
