<p class="TaleDestiny">(1251) - WILDERNESS LORE, GOLDEN BRIDLE</p>
<p>Before you lies the dread Valley of Dogs. Concerned for your safety, you spend a day scouting the beginning of the trail.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: When you feel ready, you enter the valley. Not one mile down the road you are attacked by vicious wild dogs. They savage you, and most of your possessions are scattered to the four winds. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You discover a hidden path through the upper part of the valley. You traverse the valley in safety. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">GOLDEN BRIDLE</span>: When you feel ready, you enter the valley. Not one mile down the road you are attacked by vicious wild dogs. By the power of the Golden Bridle, you bring the fiercest dog under your control, and command him to lead the pack away from you. You pass through the Valley in peace. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
