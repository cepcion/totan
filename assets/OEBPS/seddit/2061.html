<p class="TaleDestiny">(2061) - PIETY</p>
<p>The brigands stagger to and fro, their numerous empty mugs and wineskins strewn haphazardly about the scene. One is on his knees, making nauseating wretching sounds.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &ldquo;Tsk, tsk,&rdquo; you say, wagging a finger at the drunken men. &ldquo;I pray you see the error of your ways&hellip; come morning.&rdquo; The ones who can still ambulate rise and chase you away from their camp, waving swords and spitting curses at your back as you flee. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: &ldquo;For shame!&rdquo; you shout. &ldquo;The Koran warns us, &lsquo;Approach not prayers with a mind befogged.&rsquo; Steal to survive, if you must, but you insult the Most High by this wanton intoxication!&rdquo; Suddenly sobered, the brigands thank you for reminding them of their faith, and politely ask that you join them in prayer. [D+1 / S+1 / Luck]</p>
