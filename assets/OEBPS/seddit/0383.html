<p class="TaleDestiny">(383) - BEGUILING, BRASS TRUMPET</p>
<p>Offended by your apparent snub, the other decides to humiliate you. &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;there goes the one who is the cause of all woes!&rdquo; The ever-fickle crowd pursues you relentlessly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are not treated gently by the crowd, who are convinced you are a sorcerer. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Crippled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, BRASS TRUMPET</span>: You stop and shout back at the crowd, telling them of the evil of the other. Your charisma and oratory dissuade them from harming you. In the confusion, you slip away. [D+1 / S+2]</p>
