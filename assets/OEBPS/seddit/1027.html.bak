<p class="TaleDestiny">(1027) - WEAPON USE  (M), SCHOLARSHIP</p>
<p>You come across a wounded woman by the roadside. She says she was stabbed and left for dead by an evil soldier because she would not surrender her virtue. You offer to help her, and she responds, &ldquo;If you could bring me some human flesh I would be grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE  (mandatory):</span> Repulsed, you slay the vile, helpless gooleh. Later, you suffer pangs of remorse for the cold-blooded murder. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SCHOLARSHIP</span>: You will ease her pain, but will not provide flesh. Because of your kindness, she resolves to beseech Allah for deliverance from her unnatural condition. When morning comes, she is well, and no longer does the craving for human flesh bend her mind. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
