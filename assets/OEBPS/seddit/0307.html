<p class="TaleDestiny">(307) - STORYTELLING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; says the other. &ldquo;I am troubled with sleeplessness. Tell me a tale so that the night might pass more pleasantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your feeble story does little to amuse the other, and he bids you depart from him. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You tell one story, then another, then another. The evening passes quickly, and the other slips quietly into a deep, peaceful sleep. The other awakens the next morning, refreshed and grateful, and gives you a bag of gold for your help. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
