<p class="TaleDestiny">(2233) - BEGUILING, STORYTELLING</p>
<p>People are aghast that you would attack such a fair being. A crowd gathers to subdue you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are grabbed and beaten. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Before they can enact any revenge on you, you make an impassioned speech about how beauty of the heart is the only true beauty. The crowd is pacified and lets you go. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You quickly tell the crowd that the other has used beauty to beguile you and should be punished. You are so convincing that the crowd carries the other off to the beating you should have received. Pondering your actions brings you no comfort. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
