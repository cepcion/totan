<p class="TaleDestiny">(2304) - WEAPON USE (M), SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>One evening on a voyage, you see the other, a known scoundrel, threatening a fellow passenger. You spring into action, attacking the other. Alas, too soon you discover that the other was acting righteously&mdash;his &ldquo;victim&rdquo; was a far worse villain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL, WEAPON USE (mandatory)</span>: Your quick and decisive blows slay the other before the truth can come out. You are thrown into the brig for the remainder of the voyage. [D+1 / Quick Thinking / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Despite the rocking of the ship, your blows were carefully aimed and delivered, allowing you to fell the other without permanent harm. As you discover the truth, you work with the other to apprehend the thief. You offer to pay for the other&rsquo;s treatments. [D+1 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Quick Thinking]</p>
