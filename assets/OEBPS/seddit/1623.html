<p class="TaleDestiny">(1623) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>Amidst the jumble of artifacts on the merchant's table, your attention is drawn to a wonderful statue of a horseman.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you might to divert the merchant&rsquo;s attention, he watches you like a hawk. There will be no sneaking away with this prize.
[S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You are engaged in conversation with the merchant when you &ldquo;accidentally&rdquo; drop your purse&mdash;which sounds like money when it hits the ground. The merchant immediately bends down to help pick up the purse and its contents and you take the momentary diversion to stash the artifact inside your clothes. When the purse is returned to you, you excuse yourself on the pretense of having lunch with the Vizier. [D+1 / S+2 / Brass Horseman]</p>
