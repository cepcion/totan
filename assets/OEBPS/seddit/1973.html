<p class="TaleDestiny">(1973) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>According to legend, volcanoes are a rich source of precious gems, and when you see a small volcanic island, you land to take a look around. Soon, though, you hear rumblings in the rocks that makes you fear the volcano may explode. When you return to your ship, you see that a band of red-turbaned Magians has seized it! You&rsquo;re going to have to fight in order to escape the island!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You charge the Magians, sword in hand. Smiting foes left and right, you send some of the vile cultists to their doom, but their numbers prove too great. When you wake, you find yourself in the brig of your own ship! [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Shouting prayers to the Most High that your arm might be strong enough to destroy the infidels, you leap into the midst of your foes. The battle is long and fierce, but in the end you are victorious! Truly there is no might but in Allah! [D+1 / S+1 / Piety]</p>
