<p class="TaleDestiny">(545) -  SEDUCTION (if same sex as the encounter)(M),  APPEARANCE</p>
<p>A vision of purity, obviously the lover of the other you have met, steps forward. &ldquo;Pray, stay your hand! If you were acquainted with the conditions of our love, you would not judge so harshly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are moved to sympathy, and let them go without interference. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION (if same sex as the encounter)(mandatory),  APPEARANCE</span>: As you listen to the tale, all you can think of is your lust for the other&rsquo;s lover. You press your advances, and the other cries, &ldquo;fiend!&rdquo; and begins striking you. When you wake they have gone&mdash;and so has your purse. You are consumed by guilt, and swear to attend more closely to the demands of virtue in the future. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / Piety]</p>
