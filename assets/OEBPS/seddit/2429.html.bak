<p>Though their appearance is hideous, something about the twisted creatures draws your attention and you cannot bear to look away. You find yourself examining them for many hours.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: After watching the ugly brutes for quite some time, you begin to see patterns in their behavior that remind you of the actions of other animals and even of men. A serious study of these troglodytes could prove very enlightening. [S+1 / Scholarship]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: You gradually realize that the horrible creatures are also watching you! Lest their interest grow too strong, you make a hasty retreat to the safety of the road. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
