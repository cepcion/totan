<p class="TaleDestiny">(1774) - MAGIC</p>
<p>As you sleep away your exhaustion, you are awoken by a heavy weight on your chest. You nearly panic when you see that it is the massive paw of a large lion. His eyes look deeply into yours as he sniffs at you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Remembering a tale of vanity of lions, you try to flatter the great creature. &ldquo;Oh, lion of the plain! Oh lord of beasts! Oh sire of kings! Surely one as unfortunate as myself is of no consequence to one as blessed as thee!&rdquo; The lion drinks in your kind words like a desert in a sudden shower, and he visibly relaxes. He lowers his mighty head to rest on your bosom, and soon begins to snore. It is many hours before sleep returns to you, but when you awake, the lion has gone. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Something about the eyes of the creature arrests your attention. For long minutes you stare into each other&rsquo;s eyes before you realize that he is trying to communicate something to you. When he turns to leave, you follow, and are led to a nearby shrine, dedicated to some profane false god. The lion points to a stone hidden in a hole too small for its great paw. You grasp the stone, and your body is wracked with pain! &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; you hear from above you. The lion has been transformed into the human shape of a vile Magian! &ldquo;For years I have been trapped in a beast&rsquo;s flesh, waiting for one such as you to free me! Now you shall suffer as I have for your foolishness!&rdquo; Looking down, you realize that now it is you who has taken the shape of a beast! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beast Form</span>]</p>
