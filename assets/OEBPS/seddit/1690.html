<p class="TaleDestiny">(1690) - QUICK THINKING, PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</p>
<p>The other radiates power and might. You think your only chance is to seize the initiative and run him through before he can react.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You draw your weapon and run at the other, hacking wildly at his gigantic form. A few seconds of attacking madly you realize that the other is not affected in the least by your strikes, and is simply waiting patiently for you to stop. You look up into his face, and he crushes you beneath his mighty foot before continuing on. [S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You charge the other! Though he towers above you, you run between his legs, call the blessings of Allah, and slash out while not ceasing to run. Behind you, you hear a cry of pain and a large &ldquo;thud&rdquo; of something collapsing to the ground. You do not, however, take the opportunity to look back. You keep on running and hope for the best. [S+3]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN, SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: The magics you command are great, great enough to protect you from the worst of the foul marid&rsquo;s curses. Still, when you realize the might of the other, you find it the better part of valor to retreat rather than test the very limits of your magic. [S+1]</p>
