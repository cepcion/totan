<p class="TaleDestiny">(1676) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>The other tells you that he is heading to an important party, filled with other nobles of his race. While the nobles share stories of adventure in their kingdoms, he never has anything to add. Perhaps you could tell him some of the secrets of the ways of the people of clay, that he might share them?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: While you don&rsquo;t have much in the way of stories to share, you are able to give him a few jokes to tell. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: Feeling sorry for him, you tell him a few of your most exciting stories, and encourage him to memorize your delivery so as to impress the other party-goers. The other is so grateful that he teaches you about the ways of the people of the smokeless fire. [S+1 / Magic]</p>
