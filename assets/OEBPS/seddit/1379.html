<p class="TaleDestiny">(1379) - DETERMINED  (M), SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You steel yourself against the visage of the other, sure in your resolve that attacking is the right thing to do.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Ready for the attack, you suddenly melt and cannot go through with it. The other senses your pause and uses the moment to escape&mdash;taking your heart. [D+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">DETERMINED  (mandatory):</span> Steadied for the fight you stave off any desire or compassion. The other is no match for you and you easily win the day. You seem to be the only person happy about this. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: As you ready yourself to fight you see that a crowd gathers. The other&rsquo;s visage is such that the crowd begins to take sides against you. You see that the other is seducing the crowd and you begin to work to do the same. As this battle of wills progresses, neither of you wins the crowd over. They disperse, leaving you to battle alone. The other flees through the crowd and loses you. You&rsquo;ve at least learned some tricks from the other. [S+1 / Appearance]</p>
