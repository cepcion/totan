<p>The mysterious other has been following you all day. Growing concerned, you turn on him as the sun dips low in the horizon.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you begin beating the other, he calls for help. To your amazement, the beggars in the square are revealed as bodyguards! For assaulting the prince, you find yourself cast into the dungeons. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: As you turn, arm raised to strike, you notice something odd about the other. Though you think of him as prey, you see in him the movements of a hunter. Your instincts stay your hand and you withdraw, wondering just who you spared today. [D+1 / S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
