<p class="TaleDestiny">(1325) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You come upon a living statue, its upper half a fearsome &rsquo;efreet, its lower, a pillar of basalt. &ldquo;I led an army against Solomon,&rdquo; it says. &ldquo;Solomon triumphed and imprisoned me. I have been here two thousand years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: As you step forward to free the creature, its evil invades your mind. When you awaken, a voice says, &ldquo;Seek not to undo what your lord hath wrought.&rdquo; [D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: Two-thousand years is as a few days to such a being. &ldquo;What Allah hath wrought, let no man undo,&rdquo; you reply, and help yourself to the small gems around its feet before going on. [D+3 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Piety]</p>
