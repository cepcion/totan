<p class="TaleDestiny">(2448) - ENDURING HARDSHIP</p>
<p>The creature may be the finest animal you have ever seen, but you cannot allow it to continue to harass the herds of the local shepherds. You prepare to rid them of the dangerous beast.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The creature is too dangerous to approach directly. You will have to stalk it with stealth and cunning. Careful to remain downwind, you are able to attack it with your bow. [D+1 / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ENDURING HARDSHIP</span>: You discover the favored hunting grounds of the beast. Using yourself as bait, you wait long hours into the night for it to appear. You feign sleep when it arrives, and you wait for it to creep into reach before you launch your attack. [D+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
