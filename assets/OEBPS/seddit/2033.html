<p class="TaleDestiny">(2033) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>You overhear two merchants whisper about the horde they have accumulated and how they buried it near an oasis in the desert. You are familiar with this area and you decide to wander out that way. You find a massive rock in the location that appears to have been moved recently. Although the stone is massive, you push against it, calling out Allah&rsquo;s name. Mysteriously, the rock moves, revealing a trapdoor in the ground. Raising it, you are nearly overcome by the stench that drifts up from the opening. As you back away, you notice that the inside of the trapdoor contains an enormous jewel. What a prize that would be!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are frustrated in your efforts to separate the jewel from the door, and too frightened to explore further. You march back to town defeated. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: Although the passage way is too daunting to explore, you turn your efforts toward securing the jewel. The casing resists your best tools, but the hinges prove more yielding. You drag the entire door back to town and sell it to a wealthy thief. Let him devise how to separate the gem and door if he will. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
