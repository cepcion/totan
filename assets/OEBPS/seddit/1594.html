<p class="TaleDestiny">(1594) - QUICK THINKING, SPARKLING SPEAR, MAGIC</p>
<p>Your enemy screams at your attack. Lesser jinni come to his aid.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A desperate defense wins you through and you flee, free but wounded. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Once in a story you heard a name that would bind jinn to service. You cry it out, and the lesser jinni stagger before you. Their master shakes his head with sorrow. The other promises your freedom if you do not say that name again. You agree, but also question his motives. The other spins a tale of loneliness that touches your heart. You agree to stay with the other for a while and he rejoices. The next few days become some of your fondest memories and when it is time to leave, you are given a precious gift. [D+1 / S+1 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Magic / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span> / Move to any city space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SPARKLING SPEAR</span>: You defeat the servants easily and the demeanor of the master changes: he begs forgiveness for his transgression and grants you anything you wish. [D+2 / Choice of any 1 Skill / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Pursued</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: The &rsquo;efreet laughs at your paltry attempt at magic: &ldquo;You call that magic, mortal?! I shall show you magic!&rdquo; An unseen hand grabs you and dashes you to the floor. When you regain consciousness you are wearing a servant&rsquo;s garb. Another slave puts a platter of food in your hands and directs you to your new master. As you present the food to him you trip, spilling everything onto him. The &rsquo;efreet bellows in rage and blasts you into a pile of ashes. [Death]</p>
