<p class="TaleDestiny">(1960) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>A battle between one little ship and a mighty warfleet can only end one way, but you have a scheme to even the odds. Sailing directly towards the flagship under a flag of truce, you challenge the enemy admiral to a duel!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The treacherous admiral mocks you, and has your ship seized and you clamped in irons and tossed below. You can see that his dishonorable actions cost him the respect of the crew. Before long, they secretly free you and set you ashore. [S+1 / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: Though the admiral would treat you dishonorably, you speak with such eloquence and style that his own captains force him to accept your challenge.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding two if you have <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Weapon Use</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: The admiral defeats you in fair combat. You have earned his respect, however, so he sets you ashore to tend your wounds. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / Have another player move you to any coastal space]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: After a long and tense struggle, you force the admiral to yield. In exchange for his life, he agrees to turn his fleet back. [D+2 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</li>
</ul>
