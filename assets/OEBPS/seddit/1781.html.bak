<p>You should have known better than to trust your host. Something about the way he looked at you while you were eating set you on edge. But when he offered to show you the mysteries of the 100th room, your curiosity got the better of you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your heart sinks as you hear the door slam shut behind you. You lunge for the door, but you are too late! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Suspicious, you keep your hand on your weapon as your host leads you to the last room of the palace. When he ushers you in, you refuse, insisting that he enter instead. Seeing your confidence, he obeys and you lock him in the small chamber! You learn that he has been trapping travelers here for years, extorting ransoms from their families. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely)]</p>
