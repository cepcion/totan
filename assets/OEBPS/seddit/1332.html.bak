<p class="TaleDestiny">(1332) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You pray to Allah. The next morning, the gates are open and there are people within, speaking an ancient dialect. You have traveled into the past! You ask a wizard for aid, but he says there is much danger in tampering with time.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He summons a powerful &rsquo;efreet to return you. *Poof* You find yourself outside the abandoned city&mdash;and without your memory. [D+3 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Promising him great fame, you convince the wizard to return with you to the present. *Poof* You stand outside the abandoned city; but before your eyes the wizard ages one thousand years in a heartbeat and turns to dust. [D+3 / S+3 / Magic]</p>
