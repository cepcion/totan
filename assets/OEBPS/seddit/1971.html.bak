<p class="TaleDestiny">(1971) - STEALTH AND STEALING</p>
<p>For days you have encountered the ruins of village after village, the people missing, the houses burned. Your only clue you find is a charred piece of wood with the word &ldquo;Magian&rdquo; carved into it. Ahead you see a column of smoke. Perhaps this island is where the Magians have been taking their victims?</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The island is a volcano! No doubt the Magians are hurling their innocent victims into the fiery core. You go ashore to discover dozens of islanders trapped in cages near the shore. You free the people and flee before the Magians return. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING</span>: You land  on the shore of the volcano and find the Magian camp. After freeing their prisoners, you prepare an ambush for the evil cultists&rsquo; return. The next morning, the vile fire-worshippers come back to a most unfriendly welcome! [D+1 / S+1 / Weapon Use]</p>
