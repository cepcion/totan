<p class="TaleDestiny">(1889) - QUICK THINKING, SEAMANSHIP</p>
<p>You are enraged by the other, who has ruined your robes with his filthy hands, and you begin to beat him mercilessly.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You did not realize how fragile the other was. After only a few blows, he lies dead at your feet. Unable to explain your actions, you are cast into the Sultan&rsquo;s dungeons. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: The wretch was near-dead already; you have merely ended his misery. But others may not see it that way. Quickly, you slip your purse into the dead hand of the other. Shouting &ldquo;Thief!&rdquo; you continue beating him until the guard appears. They believe your story without hesitation. [S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP</span>: Having once served as boatswain, you know how to deliver lashes without causing permanent damage. Though the other&rsquo;s days are numbered, it is not your hand that will bring about the hour of his demise. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
