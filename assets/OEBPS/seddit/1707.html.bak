<p class="TaleDestiny">(1707) - COURTLY GRACES</p>
<p>For the last few days, a persistent merman has followed your ship, demanding that you pay him a tribute of gold and gems or he will summon a mighty dendan to destroy your vessel.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You refuse to pay him what he asks, and say a number of unpleasant things about his ancestors. With a furious flick of his tail, he vanishes and you think that&rsquo;s the end of it. An hour later, however, you see a disturbance in the water as an enormous dendan charges your ship! Helpless against the creature, your vessel is smashed to pieces, leaving you floundering in the water. [Go to paragraph <a href="0315.html#TaleHeader">315</a>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: You recognize that this is no ordinary merman, but one with knowledge of magic and the creatures of the sea. You wisely choose to honor him with gifts. [D+1]</p>
