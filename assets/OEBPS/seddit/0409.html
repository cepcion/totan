<p class="TaleDestiny">(409) - BEGUILING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>You attempt to fool the other into giving you a valuable magic item, by pretending to be a scholar who has discovered the item is cursed. You learn, however, that the other is a scholar also, and will see through your blatant lies.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You hastily abandon your scheme and get out while you can.
[D+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: So confident are you in your own talents of deception that you carry through with your plans. When they fail, as they must with a victim so astute, you regret your foolishness. The other is furious, and you suffer accordingly. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
