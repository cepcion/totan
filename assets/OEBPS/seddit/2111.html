<p class="TaleDestiny">(2111) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Your caravan slowly winds its way through the mountain pass. Without warning, the rider in the lead is pulled from his mount as though by a giant invisible hand! Smashed into a nearby cliff, he is crushed instantly! Another life is lost to the dreaded Magnetic Mountain.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Clearly, a different route must be found. You volunteer to find a local guide to assist the caravan. But you quickly become lost in the maze of canyons and valleys and cannot find your way back! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: It takes you some time, but you locate a nearby village. A boy there offers to show you a safe path around the mountain for a single dinar. You gratefully accept his deal. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
