<p class="TaleDestiny">(1064) - PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</p>
<p>You have come across an object which shimmers and glints like a precious stone. As you peer closer, you note with fascination its many hidden depths.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are mesmerized by the beauty of the object. Through a haze, you note a grinning sorcerer relieving you of your possessions. The haze stays with you long after he departs. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span> (1 turn)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PROTECTIVE TALISMAN</span>: Closing your eyes, you pronounce a magical word, breaking the spell on the object, which is but a piece of cut glass. You slay the sorcerer who is hiding nearby and find a most interesting item on him. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
