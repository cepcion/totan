<p class="TaleDestiny">(2312) - STEALTH AND STEALING, BEGUILING</p>
<p>Your pockets were picked by an expert and you have lost not a few bits of gold. Fortunately, you know of a thief who owes you a favor and could help you recover your stolen money. Unfortunately, your acquaintance is imprisoned and will be publicly executed the next day.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He is too heavily guarded for you to reach him by force, nor have you coin enough to bribe the guards. [W-1 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STEALTH AND STEALING, BEGUILING</span>: Through sneaking in the dark corners and fast talking in the open light, you are able to meet with the thief in his cell and tell your tale. He agrees to help if you save him from his fate. At the next dawn, a distraction you engineered allows you to ride by on a swift horse and lift the thief up into your saddle, his guards still confused and clueless. He repays you as promised, helping you to recover your stolen property. [D+2 / S+1]</p>
