<p class="TaleDestiny">(1814) - LUCK</p>
<p>Against the advice of your native guide, you enter the serpent-haunted wood in pursuit of the treasures rumored to be within. If your guide had only told you how big the serpents were, you might have taken his advice. Now you find yourself facing a snake far larger than you could ever have imagined.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The serpent is so long you cannot see both ends of it at once! You could never hope to vanquish a creature that could crush elephants in its coils. You have no choice but to flee from the forest empty-handed. [S+1 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: Monsters the size of this serpent may be strong and powerful, but they don&rsquo;t move very quickly. You deftly avoid getting entangled in its coils and retrieve the lost treasures! [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
