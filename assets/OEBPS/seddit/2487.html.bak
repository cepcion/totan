<p class="TaleDestiny">(2487) - MAGIC</p>
<p>As you approach an oasis deep in the desert, you hear a most beautiful, haunting song. Drawing closer, you spy a beautiful youth singing by the water. The other&rsquo;s song tells of lost love, unrequited love, and the despair of frustrated dreams. Yet something is odd. You notice the pool at her feet is nearly filled with human bones. Panic grips you but still you cannot help but move closer. Drawing your sword, you prepare to strike.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Summoning all your will, you bring your weapon to bear against this haunting figure. Your blow is feeble and faltering. The enchantress smiles, showing the razor sharp teeth and serpent tongue of an accursed marid! You are lucky to escape with only a handful of deep bites. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Realizing that you are under a spell, you whisper words of great power. This allows your blow to strike true&mdash;despite your shaking hand and muddled mind. The figure shrieks, showing vicious teeth and a pointed tongue. After it flees into the desert, you discover a most interesting item just below the surface of the pool. [D+1 / S+1 / Treasure]</p>
