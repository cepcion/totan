<p>With a single swipe of its mighty claw, the beast knocks you from your mount before you are even aware of it. Too shaken to fight, you stagger to your feet and flee towards the town.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Luck</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Enduring Hardship</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Blessed</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Fated</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2: Your feet fail you and the shapeless form leaps onto your back. The last thing you hear is a curious warbling sound&mdash;a sound ripped from your own throat! [Death]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">3&ndash;7: You tumble down the hillside with the beast right behind, cutting and tearing at you with its great talons. Eventually it gives up the pursuit, and you thank Allah for his mercy. [S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: With a burst of strength from deep within, you put some distance between you and the creature before you tumble to the ground. Thankfully, you are close enough to the walls of the nearby town for the guards to see you, and their arrows chase the beast away. [D+1]</li>
