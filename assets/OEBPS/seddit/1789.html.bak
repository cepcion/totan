<p class="TaleDestiny">(1789) - ONE HUNDRED KEYS</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to have lost my keys,&rdquo; the old man tells you when you ask to see the rest of his magnificent palace. &ldquo;I must have left them in one of the rooms,&rdquo; he mutters. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not the room with the golden door, though, so make sure you stay out of that room.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your search of the first 99 rooms is fruitless. Surely it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to examine the last one too?</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you open the golden door?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If yes</span>: Within you find a magnificent garden. A swan-maiden is swimming in the pool, and you are entranced by her beauty! How can you win the heart of such a beauteous creature? [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Love Struck</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If no</span>: Your host finds you outside the door with his keys in hand. He sees that you have obeyed his wishes and he is impressed. He pays you handsomely for your help and honesty. [D+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ONE HUNDRED KEYS</span>: Suspicious of what wondrous treasure he has hidden in that hundredth room, you take your keys and take a look for yourself. Within you find an incredible garden. A swan-maiden is splashing in the pool and is surprised when you arrive. She thanks you for freeing her from her imprisonment. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
