<p class="TaleDestiny">(468) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Your intervention prevents the ugly other from pressing his perverse suit on a comely youth, who is very grateful to you.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are of the opposite sex or are Married</span>: The comely youth insists you accept a small gift in gratitude. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are the same sex and are not Married</span>: The grateful&mdash;and most lovely&mdash;youth takes both your hands in his, and leads you to a private place where you spend an evening in most pleasant play.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The skills of the other are most remarkable, and you are exhausted by your love-play. When the morning comes, though, he is gone. [S+1 / Seduction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: When the dawn comes, you find love growing between you like wildflowers. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Beloved</span>]</p>
