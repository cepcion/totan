<p class="TaleDestiny">(2556) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>Riding into a valley, you hear drums coming from nearby. Curious, you investigate and see a town. Atop a high building, men in red robes and turbans are executing men in chains. By their garb, you realize they are a band of dervishes. They refuse to cry out in terror! Gathering your strength, you race up the tower, grab the oldest of the dervishes, leap off to a nearby rooftop. The dervish quickly explains how the Magians came and ensorcelled the townsfolk, while you look for a way to reach the ground.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The only way down is a drop five times the height of a man, which would surely kill the aged dervish. The other insists on staying behind. &ldquo;Go and bring us freedom; I will die with my fellows.&rdquo; You return days later with a band of soldiers, and find no survivors in the town.

<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: Directly below you there is the roof of a slave barracks. With the help of the dervish, you free the two dozen men within and arm them with shovels and axes, then proceed to lead the charge on the tower. With each guard your mob brings down, you gain a sword, and soon you overwhelm all the Magians and free the town.
