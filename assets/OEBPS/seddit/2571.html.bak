<p class="TaleDestiny">(2571) - MAGIC</p>
<p>Walking into a small village, you find it oddly quiet and empty. Certainly, the shopkeeper appears to have a kind smile, the innkeeper to be a thin woman, and the stable boy to be industrious. Still, you realize that you never see more than one person at a time. You grab the next person you see&mdash;an old woman selling figs from a street blanket&mdash;and she turns out to be a nondescript young man in disguise. He explains that he betrayed the village to an evil Vizier, who rounded up the inhabitants for vile magical experiments. Instead of payment, the man has been cursed to act out the roles of all the dead villagers. Over time, he has developed a great facility with disguises. Amazed by his skills, you offer to pay him to teach you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The young man is willing but cannot ignore the curse long enough to teach you. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: Whispering a long incantation, and performing several gestures, you dispel the magic binding him. Overjoyed, he agrees to accompany you, putting his skills to use in your adventures. [D+2 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
