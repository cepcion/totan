<p class="TaleDestiny">(2480) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>As you are sitting in a seaside tavern, you look up to see the other, accompanied a grizzled old sailor. The other slides onto the bench next to you. &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;how would you like a job?&rdquo; You notice the old sailor appears to be hiding something behind his back. You reach for your sword and gesture for the &ldquo;recruiter&rdquo; to find himself another mark; you have no desire to wake up on a ship way out at sea.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other scoffs at you, and before you can react, the thug swings quickly. The next thing you know, the ground beneath you sways and only the smell of salt fills your nostrils. You are told that your service will last one year, so you had best learn fast. [D+1 / Seamanship / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You flash your sword towards his face and he stumbles backward. The others in the tavern, most of whom are his crewmates, rise to defend their companion. You fight bravely, and your foresight may have saved you from years aboard a ship. Now if only you could find a place to recover from the beating. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
