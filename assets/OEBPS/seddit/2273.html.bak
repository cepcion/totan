<p>With a baleful glare, the other looks at you and spits out a curse. &ldquo;You presume to punish me, little one? ME?!&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you may, you cannot get the upper hand on the other. Now you are faced with a curse and your will is not strong enough to withstand it. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You regret your rash action and fear the consequences of the curse. You hold out your hands, palms up, hoping to slow the other&rsquo;s actions. He slows, but gives you a suspicious eye. You explain that you were wrong to accuse him, apologizing profusely. He agrees to share some insights from his life with you as you clearly need instruction in the ways of the world. [D+1 / Wisdom / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span>]</p>
