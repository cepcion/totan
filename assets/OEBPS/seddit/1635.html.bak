<p class="TaleDestiny">(1635) - MAGIC, MAGIC SADDLEBAGS</p>
<p>You come to a city that is exceedingly poor. Lined up on every street are throngs of beggars who want some of your coin. You find your way through, but before you arrive at your destination, the other catches you up and humbly beseeches you for help in feeding and housing these unfortunate people here. It is a task even beyond his ability.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: While you might be able to give some coins, it will not alleviate the problems this city faces. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You lend your talents to the other and together you are able to create shelters in a short amount of time. With the aid of jinns and other bound spirits, together you turn the wastelands around the city into farmland, which the people are eager to work. It is a temporary relief, but one that will be appreciated by all. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC SADDLEBAGS</span>: You donate your treasure to the other and the people rejoice as bountiful food is made available to all. The other rewards you with treasure and knowledge. [D+2 / Magic / Lose Magic Saddlebags / Book of Hidden Secrets]</p>
