<p class="TaleDestiny">(1945) - WEAPON USE at Talent level, WEAPON USE at Master level (M), DETERMINED (M)</p>
<p>While you are attending a wedding celebration on the Islands of Camphor, you stumble upon a plot to assassinate the Sultan!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You raise a cry of alarm when you discover the intruders. Knowing that their numbers are too great for you alone to fight, you trick them into chasing you through the palace. There are so many rooms and passageways that you quickly confuse and disorient the would-be assassins, and the palace guards quickly respond to your alarm.
[D+2 / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE at Talent level</span>: With a shout and a challenge, you whip out your scimitar and plunge into the mass of intruders. You fell two of the rogues before their numbers overwhelm you and a blow to the back of your head drops a black curtain over the world. You hope that the clamor of battle was enough to warn the Sultan. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE at Master level, DETERMINED  (All mandatory)</span>: You calmly draw the curved blade of your bejeweled scimitar, a recent gift from the Sultan, and cast your dark gaze on the intruders. Unnerved by your steady resolve, they attack you reluctantly. Though you are nicked and cut with many minor wounds, you quickly dispatch half of the thugs, and the rest flee in terror from your whirling blade. When he learns of your bravery and skill, the Sultan rewards you most handsomely [D+2 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Princely) / Thunderbolt Sword]</p>
