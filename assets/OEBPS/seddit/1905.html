<p class="TaleDestiny">(1905) - SEAMANSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>Those who carry such illness shouldn&rsquo;t go forth in public! You beat the other for his recklessness.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The locals are relieved that you were brave enough to chase the other off. The townsfolk view you as a hero. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEAMANSHIP, WILDERNESS LORE</span>: As you vent your anger on the unfortunate other, you realize that he merely suffers from scurvy and presents no danger to others. Feeling remorse for your cruel actions, you offer to aid the other for his pains. [D+1 / W-1 (Min: Respectable) / Piety]</p>
