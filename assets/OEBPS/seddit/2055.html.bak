<p class="TaleDestiny">(2055) - ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>While walking around the Sultan&rsquo;s fair port, you spy a brigand that you recognize as a member of the Cleanfoot Gang, a group of petty thieves obsessed with cleanliness. You wait until the thug enters a crowd, and then move up to walk behind him. At the same time as you reach for his purse, you unleash a massive bout of coughing. Disgusted, the thief runs away, ignorant of his loss.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: A nice haul for such a simple trick! [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable / Stealth and Stealing]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You follow the thug back to the Cleanfoot Gang&rsquo;s hideout. Once you know the location, you disguise yourself to appear as a diseased leper and wait for most of the gang to leave. You then enter the hideout and throw yourself bodily onto the gang&rsquo;s loot, causing the remaining brigands to run screaming from the place. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
