<p>Intrigued, the other gives you the opportunity to assist him as his herald for an event at court.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You attempt your best to flourish the introduction, but are returned only a few weary stares and yawns. The other thanks you, slides you some coin and sends you on your way. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Poor) / Courtly Graces]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">COURTLY GRACES</span>: For the day, you race about the city spending coins on attire suitable for the grand court. As the evening nears you practice your words assiduously. At the appointed time you make the formal introduction of the other. So moved is the court that the other is seated at the place of high honor. The evening is a great success for him, and he sings your praises for some time to come. [D+2 / S+1 / W-1 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
