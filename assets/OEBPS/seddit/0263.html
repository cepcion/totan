<p class="TaleDestiny">(263) - BEGUILING, ACTING AND DISGUISE, BRASS TRUMPET  (M)</p>
<p>The other is crazed and obviously obsessed with you. You find the other pitiful in ways, and repulsive in others. The other has tried a disguise to trick you. Thinking the other might have evil intentions, you try to avoid him. You do escape, but the other cries out to you, &ldquo;I will stab out at you in ways that you cannot imagine!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You are soon stripped of your wealth and reputation by the backbiting and rumor-mongering of the other. [D+1 / W-2 (Min: Penniless) / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><B>BEGUILING, ACTING AND DISGUISE:</B> You decide to go on the offensive and, in a disguise, you speak to the other of yourself and discover why the other hates you. With this knowledge you are able to make amends and (strange are the ways of Allah!) become successful business partners with the other. [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Respectable) / Bargaining and Evaluation]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BRASS TRUMPET  (mandatory):</span> You try to escape but the other confronts you in a public place. The Brass Trumpet sounds its note of warning, making clear to all the evil intents of the other, and delivering you from all suspicion of wrong-doing. [D+2 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
