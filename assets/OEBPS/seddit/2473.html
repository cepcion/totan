<p class="TaleDestiny">(2473) - None</p>
<p>You must have been cursed by some malicious spirit, for every time you try to eat, a flying creature of some kind steals the food from your very mouth! If you cannot find a way to be rid of these terrible beasts, you will surely starve. You have heard of a wise woman who makes her home in a forest near here, and you seek out her help.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;4: She refuses to help you, leaving you to wander the wilderness until your hunger drives you mad. [Enduring Hardship / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">5&ndash;8: She agrees to help you, but at a cost. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Under Geas</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">9+: She takes one look at you and immediately offers her aid. She tells you that dark forces seek to block your destiny. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Fated</span> / Lose. [<span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
</ul>
