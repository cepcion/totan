<p class="TaleDestiny">(1524) - SEDUCTION (if you are female), APPEARANCE (if you are male)</p>
<p>At your words, the jailor responds with, &ldquo;Yes, yes, I can never tire of your flattery. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll bring you an extra piece of bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Try as you might, you cannot persuade him to give you your freedom&hellip; but your meals are better than they were before. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION (if you are female)</span>: &ldquo;Hmm, how badly do you want your freedom?&rdquo; His green-toothed leer nearly shrivels your plans, but you still manage to say, &ldquo;I will do anything.&rdquo; With those words the jailor enters your prison&hellip; where you brain him with the rock you were holding behind you. [Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE (if you are male)</span>: &ldquo;Hmm, I have an unfortunate daughter who could do worse than marry you. If you promise to wed my daughter and care for her, I will free you.&rdquo; You feel you have no choice in the matter if your story is to continue in this world.
