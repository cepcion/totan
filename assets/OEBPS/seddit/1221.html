<p class="TaleDestiny">(1221) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>What a predicament! You and your companions are captured by a hideous giant who, each day, takes one of your group and cooks him on a spit.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Despairing, you commend your souls to Allah. That night, a huge thunderstorm begins. Lightning strikes the giant&rsquo;s pavilion, and while the giant is trapped under the fallen canopy, you lead the captives to slay him with stones. [D+1 / Piety]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You and your companions make a great show of drinking wine from your bottles. The giant snatches them up and drinks them all down in seconds. While he is in a drunken stupor, you slay him and escape. [D+1 / S+1 / Acting and Disguise]</p>
