<p class="TaleDestiny">(2104) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>Despite the warnings from the locals, you now find yourself stuck to the side of the Magnetic Mountain. Surely you will starve to death if you cannot convince some passerby to assist you.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your calls for help and pleading avail you not the least. All who come within range of your voice are too afraid of sharing your fate to venture any closer. Somehow, after Allah alone knows how long, you manage to free yourself. But it seems you left your sanity crushed against that wall of stone. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Insane</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: After too many refusals to count, a brave young man finally comes near you. He asks what reward you will give him for assisting you in your escape. You finally negotiate a price he is willing to accept. Between him, you, and the pair of oxen he was leading, you are free.</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you pay the young man the fee you promised?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If yes</span>: Give him one Treasure of your choice, if you have one. If not, then W-3 (Min: Penniless). Word of your honesty and generosity spreads far and wide. [D+1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If no (or you have no Treasure and your wealth is Beggar)</span>: You discover to your dismay that this young man is well-versed in the dark arts. When you refuse to pay him, he spits a curse before continuing on his way. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Accursed</span>]</li>
</ul>
