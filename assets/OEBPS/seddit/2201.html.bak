<p>The other looks at you with a sneer on his face. &ldquo;And who are you to speak to me so? I don&rsquo;t need your wares or your assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other is not convinced by your complimentary words and leaves you swiftly. To make matters worse, another witnesses your humiliation and spreads the tale throughout town. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You manage to fool the other into thinking you travel in the same circles he does. After spending a few nights at his side, you realize the other is not possessed of all his faculties. So as to avoid wasting any more time dealing with a crackpot, you slip away into the dark one night, thanking Allah for your wits. [D+1 / S+2]</p>
