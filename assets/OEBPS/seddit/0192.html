<p class="TaleDestiny">(192) - SEDUCTION, ACTING AND DISGUISE</p>
<p>Your professions of love are met by ones equally strong, and soon you are deep in the planning of your wedding. The night before the ceremony, though, a faithful servant comes and tells you of the cruel jest that has been played upon you&mdash;the other intends to humiliate you before your family and the judges by denying the marriage.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You denounce the faithless other to all around, and call the servant in testimony. You praise fortune for having delivered you from this sham. [D+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION, ACTING AND DISGUISE</span>: You go to your intended, and pretend not to know of his wicked plan. Instead, you lavish him with all the praise and flattery you can call to mind, shaming him for his deceit. Chastened by your devotion, he renounces his trickery and becomes in turn a devoted, loving spouse and a joy for your remaining days. [D+1 / S+1 / Appearance/<span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]
