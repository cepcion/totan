<p class="TaleDestiny">(1951) - LUCK</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been following a band of explorers for days now, hoping that they would indeed lead you to the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard. It seems that your patience has been rewarded! You wait until night, then attack their camp!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: It is easy enough to overcome men asleep in their camp, but you are careless and some of them escape. Though enriched by your ill-gotten gains, you know that you will not be welcome long in this Sultan&rsquo;s domain. [S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich) / <span class="TaleStatus">Outlaw</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">LUCK</span>: You count yourself twice blessed when you examine the men in the camp and realize that they are a band of wanted men! The Sultan may reward you for bringing justice to such evil-doers! [D+1 / S+1 / W+2 (Max: Rich)]</p>
