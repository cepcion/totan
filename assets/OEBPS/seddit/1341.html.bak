<p class="TaleDestiny">(1341) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>When you have collected many gems from the walls, you enter the fortress itself, and finally find stairs to the treasure room. As you walk down, you hear a click.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fall through a trap door into a stinking hole. You endure many days in misery until, with the passage of time, you observe the coming and going of the many rats that surround you. Finally, you realize you can follow them to the outside world. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Quick Thinking]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: You hurl yourself to one side and avoid the trap. You then find the treasure and help yourself to it. [D+3 / S+2 / W+3 (Max: Princely) / Treasure]</p>
