<p class="TaleDestiny">(1666) - BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</p>
<p>The other is quite old and feeble&mdash;time ravages even the people of the Dusky Land. He is in sorrow because his human spouse has vanished. The other quizzes you about the habits of humanity, still a puzzle even after all these years among your kind.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You answer all of the other&rsquo;s strange questions as best you can. In the end, the other&rsquo;s attention drifts elsewhere and you are alone again. Though you have lost some time on your journey, you are happy to have given some small comfort to such a one. [D+1 / S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BARGAINING AND EVALUATION</span>: You agree to answer all the questions about humanity if the other will answer your questions about the jinni. Gladly you spend many hours deep in conversation, and eventually something you say gives the other the key to finding the wayward spouse. The other vanishes, but not before saying a blessing on your behalf. [Magic / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
