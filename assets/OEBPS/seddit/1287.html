<p class="TaleDestiny">(1287) - WISDOM</p>
<p>You convince a local wizard to aid you. He calls on a multitude of spirits and powers, and the cave opens before you. &ldquo;I must remain here,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Go fetch what you can.&rdquo; You climb down and are dazzled by the wealth you find. You greedily begin to gather treasure&hellip;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: &hellip;when suddenly you recall the old Wizard and rush back; the ground is closed! You were too long! The only other exit is so narrow that you must abandon the riches to escape. What a fool you were to allow your greed to so overwhelm your sense! [D+2 / S+2 / Wisdom]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: &hellip;and rush back to the hole in time. The wizard takes one item and lets you keep the rest. [D+3 / S+2 / W+2 (Max: Princely) / Quick Thinking / Treasure]
