<p class="TaleDestiny">(1810) - STORYTELLING</p>
<p>Resting near a secluded well, you are shocked to see a serpentine creature emerge from the water. At the tail of the snake is a human head! Once you get over your initial shock, you discover that it is capable of speech, and you begin to converse with the creature. You learn that it has become lost in a land far from home.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fearing that the beast means to devour you, you quickly agree to help as much as you can. You eventually learn that it has wandered from the Mughal lands far to the east, and you point out the direction it should travel. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">STORYTELLING</span>: You remember tales from your travels in the Mughal lands of such creatures, called Nagah. In those lands it is said that they are intelligent and often generous when treated with respect. Bowing, you address the beast as if it were the Sultan himself. Flattered by such treatment, the Nagah grants you a mystical boon as reward for your kindness and aid. [D+1 / S+1 / Courtly Graces / <span class="TaleStatus">Blessed</span>]</p>
