<p class="TaleDestiny">(1280) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>The incantations you learned work! The door slides aside. Within, the cave floor is paved with gold, and diamonds glitter from the walls! Ahead is a room full of gems. Upon a couch the most beautiful woman sits, with a face to rival the full moon!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Her perfume fills your nostrils and drives thought from your mind. Later you awaken outside the caves and cannot open them again. But the perfume still lingers in your memory, driving away other thoughts. [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Ensorcelled</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: Ah, the woman is a trap! You quickly pass this room and find that many other chambers exist, containing what you seek. [D+3 / S+3 / Quick Thinking / Draw two Treasures]</p>
