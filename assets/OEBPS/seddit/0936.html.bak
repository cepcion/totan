<p class="TaleDestiny">(936) - BEGUILING</p>
<p>You see a poor man leading a fine mule. There is something strange about its appearance and you come closer to study it.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The man eyes you suspiciously, and sensing your ill intent, immediately hurries into a crowd of locals. [D-1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">BEGUILING</span>: You craftily slip the guide rope from the mule&rsquo;s head, placing it over yours, and follow along behind while an accomplice leads the mule away. Soon, the man turns and discovers you. You quickly explain that you were enchanted into the body of a mule, and have through the blessings of the Compassionate God changed back. The gullible man lets you free and you return to the mule and discover what was so odd&mdash;she is gravid! A fertile mule will fetch a high price indeed. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable) / Quick Thinking]</p>
