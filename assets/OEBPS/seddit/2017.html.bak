<p class="TaleDestiny">(2017) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>A heavily robed beggar staggers against you, his stench offending your nostrils. He clutches at your arm with gray-skinned hands. As you push him away, his hood falls off and you see the horrid visage of a young gool. &ldquo;Please sir, I&rsquo;ve lost my mother and I must eat. Won&rsquo;t you help me?&rdquo; </p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Aghast, you draw your sword. You panic the crowd. In the confusion, the scared youngster slips away. You cannot catch him. [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: Your lightning draw staggers the beast, and you quickly dispatch him. The crowd is impressed with your skill and your willingness to do what had to be done. [D+1 / S+1 / Piety / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>] (1 turn)]</p>
