<p class="TaleDestiny">(762) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You follow it over hill and dale, through thick undergrowth and lonely wasteland. Finally the snake disappears into a hole in the ground, and you still have no idea where you are.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You fall to your knees, weeping and cursing, lost and alone. But soon, a noise like muted thunder penetrates your self-inflicted pity. You crawl up a dune to see beyond and witness brilliantly-clad warriors, whose colors match the snake you followed. Surely, this is Allah&rsquo;s doing. You call out to the warriors, hands waving. The leader stops and approaches.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Piety</span> and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Wisdom</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;7: The leader asks for the location of a particular city&mdash;but you have not heard of such a place and therefore you cannot help him. Still, the leader takes pity on your situation and brings you to the nearest civilized area, where you can continue your journey. [D+1 / S+1 / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">8+: The leader looks at you closely and exclaims he had a dream about you last night. Surely this is an omen! He puts you on his horse and takes you to the king whom they serve. The king invites you to eat with him as you relate your tales of adventure. Your tales astonish and excite the king and when you are finished he gives you a purse of one thousand gold and orders his Vizier to give you a map to your destination. [D+2 / S+2 / W+1 (Max: Rich) / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: However, you recognize this area as a dry stream bed and follow it; soon you come to a small town, and ask of the natives directions to lands you know. [S+1 / Piety / Lose <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</p>
