<p class="TaleDestiny">(890) - QUICK THINKING</p>
<p>As you journey on your way, you see a most peculiar sight: a great snake, whose flesh is as clear as water and whose scales sparkle like cut diamonds, slithers across your path, pursued by a larger serpent, black and foul of form and scent.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Fearful, you step back, and both snakes are gone from sight before you can blink. Could you have imagined the whole sight? [S+1]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">QUICK THINKING</span>: With a cry, you grab a rock and hurl it at the black snake, crushing its skull. The other snake cries out in a joyful voice and melts into the form of a lustfully beautiful youth. Seizing you, the youngster says, &ldquo;That vile enchanter stole my form from me and would have slain me had you not interceded! My heart melts in gratitude, and I will love and marry thee if thou desirest.&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are not Married</span>: The sight sets your soul aflame, and you take the other&rsquo;s hand and lead on to a safer place. Praise Allah! [D+2 / S+2 / <span class="TaleStatus">Married</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If you are</span>: Though this one&rsquo;s beauty sets your very soul aflame with desire, you think of your spouse who awaits you, and you decline. You lead on to safety, and all who hear of this marvel at your tale. [D+2 / S+2]</li>
