<p>You are wakened in the middle of the cool night by a sound outside of your tent! Someone is moving around your camp. You draw your scimitar, step out, and accost the stranger. A young man stands there, proud despite his ragged and emaciated appearance. He demands sustenance and a place to rest. You spy an air of nobility about him, and decide to honor his request. After a meal, the man reveals that he is a merchant from a highborn family but has lost his entourage and his way. If you lead him to a nearby settlement, he will reward you.</p>
<p class="TaleRoll2D">Roll two dice, adding one each for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Acting and Disguise</span>, <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Appearance</span>, and <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Beguiling</span>. Add two for <span class="TaleRoll2DSkill">Courtly Graces</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">2&ndash;4: The merchant is appalled by your crass behavior as you travel together. He decides that you are not fit for polite company. Perhaps a few years in the mines will teach you manners! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Imprisoned</span>]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">5&ndash;9: You pass a pleasant several days together as you travel. At the next town, he proves true to his word and rewards your aid. [D+1 / S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</li>
<li class="TaleDieRollResult">10+: The merchant is enchanted by you. Upon reaching civilization, he lauds your grace and bearing. He offers you fine accommodations and shows you his excellent library. You are free to stay and study for as long as you wish. [D+1 / S+1 / Scholarship / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</li>
