<p class="TaleDestiny">(1967) - APPEARANCE</p>
<p>After the pirates robbed you, you were happy to see the Sultan&rsquo;s large warfleet.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The admiral is enraged to learn that pirates are operating so close to the city. You guide him to the place where you were attacked, and before long the fleet has located the scoundrels. Seeing that their position is hopeless, the pirates surrender. Your goods are returned to you, along with a little extra as a reward for your efforts. [D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">APPEARANCE</span>: When the admiral sees your delicate features and attractive looks, he decides that you probably never earned the soft life the pirates took from you. He is unimpressed by your tale and orders you removed from his sight. [S+1 / W-2 (Min: Poor) / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
