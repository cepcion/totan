<p class="TaleDestiny">(1784) - None</p>
<p>Having wandered lost in the mountains for days, you are grateful to find a fabulous palace. The owner of the palace is a kindly old man who welcomes you and listens intently to your tale. He offers to assist you on one condition: while you are his guest, you must not enter the hundredth room!</p>
<p class="TaleChoicePrompt">Do you accept his bargain?</p>
<ul>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If yes</span>: After a week, the old man summons you into the courtyard. There you see a giant bird, fitted with a curious saddle and harness. Amazement battles with fear as you climb onto the curious mount, who takes you wherever you command. [S+1 / Move up to ten spaces in any direction]</li>
<li class="TaleChoice"><span class="TaleChoiceOption">If no</span>: Your selfish curiosity gets the better of you, and you cannot resist the lure of knowing what hides behind that forbidden panel. But as soon as you open the door, the entire palace vanishes around you like a folded tent! Now you are lost and without a kindly host to aid you! [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Lost</span>]</li>
</ul>
