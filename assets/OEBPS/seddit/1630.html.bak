<p>The one seek yells for your help. He is sinking into a pile of quicksand. He has enough sense not to struggle and make his demise quicker. Your instinct is to help, but then you notice that the other is one who has exploited you and others in the past. You tell the other that if he swears before Allah to return all the wealth that he has obtained dishonestly, you will rescue him. If he does not agree, you promise to push him under and take his wealth to redistribute yourself.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other&rsquo;s words sound bitter and false. He curses your name as you push him under. You try to find his wealth, but it seems he has taken most of it with him to his sandy grave. [S+1 / W+1 (Max: Rich)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WISDOM</span>: The other agrees quickly, but you don&rsquo;t believe him. You place your foot on his back, and push slightly. Panicked, he says again that he will make sure, swearing to Allah. You believe him this time, and pull him out. True to his word, with you keeping a watchful eye, he returns all that he has dishonestly taken. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
