<p class="TaleDestiny">(2005) - MAGIC</p>
<p>A gathering of raucous citizens surrounds a colorfully robed and turbaned man and a crippled old woman. He is performing an elaborate ritual in an attempt to cure her of her afflictions. He has mesmerized the crowd with his words, his gestures, and a heady incense. Further at the back, you are unaffected. You also remember seeing the old wretch earlier that day, walking about on both, apparently very sound, legs. You push forward, calling on Allah to end this sham before anyone is falsely separated from his coins.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: Your interruption breaks the trance spun by the performer. Annoyed, the crowd find your sanctimonious urgings and off-putting manner a poor substitute for the old man&rsquo;s enchanting air. They leer you until you depart. [S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">MAGIC</span>: You note the foolishness of the would-be magician&rsquo;s rituals, and stomp out the burning incense. You finish with a flashy spell that sends the old woman sprawling, revealing the strap holding her leg under her wraps. The crowd beats both man and woman alike. [D+1 / S+2 / Beguiling / <span class="TaleStatus">Respected</span>]</p>
