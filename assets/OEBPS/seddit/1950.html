<p class="TaleDestiny">(1950) - WEAPON USE</p>
<p>Following the tattered old map you found, you reach the edge of what can only be the Elephant&rsquo;s Graveyard! But you look up to see another band of explorers who arrived at the same time! You will not share this wealth with anyone!</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You charge across the field of bones to attack the others. But the treacherous earth turns your ankle, and you are badly hurt by falling on the sharp bones. You watch in helpless fury as the other explorers load up on ivory. They are stealing your bones! [D-1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span> / <span class="TaleStatus">Envious</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WEAPON USE</span>: You leap into the midst of the other explorers as they begin to collect the precious ivory. Not expecting such a violent reception, they are quickly scattered or killed. Looking down, you realize what your greed has done! In shame you flee from the area, hoping that none of the survivors recognize you. [D-1 / S+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Grief Stricken</span>]</p>
