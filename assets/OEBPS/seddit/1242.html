<p class="TaleDestiny">(1242) - WILDERNESS LORE</p>
<p>You must sleep soon, but along this mountain trail are many large serpents which could swallow you in one bite! What to do? You pray to Allah to help you find a safe hiding space.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You try sleeping in a tree, but before you even close your eyes, a serpent plucks you from the branches. As he is about to eat you, a gigantic roc swoops down and carries both of you off, and you fall from the serpent&rsquo;s mouth some distance away. Allah be praised, you are unhurt. [D+1 / Have another player move you up to four spaces in any direction]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">WILDERNESS LORE</span>: You gather wood, binding it over your feet, your head, and along your sides. The serpents regard you as an unpleasant mouthful and leave you unmolested. [D+1 / S+1 / Quick Thinking]</p>
