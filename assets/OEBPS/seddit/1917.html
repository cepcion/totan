<p class="TaleDestiny">(1917) - SEDUCTION</p>
<p>You can tell that there is more than meets the eye with the other. You decide to give him some coins from your purse to gauge his response.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: The other grins at you and thanks you profusely. Only later do you realize that he also stole your purse! [D-1 / W-2 (Min: Poor)]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">SEDUCTION</span>: You are skilled enough to know when someone is playing you for advantage. Once again, your instincts are correct. The other is a common thief! Catching him red-handed, you turn him in for a reward.
[D+1 / W+1 (Max: Respectable)]</p>
