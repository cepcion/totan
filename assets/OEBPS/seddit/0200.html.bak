<p>The other asks your aid in arranging an audience for him with one of your friends, a very influential merchant of a nearby city.</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: You do so willingly. The other turns out to be a false swindler who dupes and cheats the merchant and you are blamed for your poor judgment. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Scorned</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">ACTING AND DISGUISE, BRASS TRUMPET</span>: A certain tone in the voice of the other makes clear to you that his intentions are far from honest and he intends to swindle your friend. You denounce him for his falseness and mark clearly in your mind the ways of the dishonest. [D+2 / Wisdom]
