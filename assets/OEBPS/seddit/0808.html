<p class="TaleDestiny">(808) - PIETY</p>
<p>The soldier is suspicious of you and constantly looks in all directions for hidden enemies. You note the fine make of his sword, and offer to buy it. At this, he howls, &ldquo;I knew it! You have been sent by my enemies to rob my defenses!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">NO SKILL</span>: He beats you soundly despite your protestations of innocence, and you flee from his madness. [D+1 / <span class="TaleStatus">Wounded</span>]</p>
<p><span class="TaleSkill">PIETY</span>: Others come to your aid, protesting your innocence, for your virtue is well known. The soldier is chagrined by his error and offers you the service of his strong right arm for your protection to make up for the insult he has delivered. [D+1 / Weapon Use (1 use)]</p>
